The Tailor
He's great at sewing
He introduces himself as 'A humble travelling tailor' bowing extravagantly probably
Is informal and relaxed but always polite
Considerate and conversational in favour of others
Says very little except idle upbeat conversation
Is understated when urgent or danger afoot
He's a great hairdresser but will never mention it because he doesn't ever brag, but he does re-adjust Toms hair
When arriving at taverns he's always up to his arms in women and friends by the end of the evening
Never offends anyone
He knows the tales and specifics of magic items 
He has a foil sword and is an exceptional sword fighter with a dandy style
He will negotiate with you in good spirits while fighting and hope to end up drinking or singing or both
Too often he will know people at taverns sometimes because of a prior adventure
He's an amazing dresser

Always presents himself as a humble tailor.. but actually he is secretly an inter-dimensional bard
- He plays the lute and has a Lute of Unfolding*1 while he never transforms in public, but is often seen playing an 'old haggard looking lute'
- He travels interdimensionally by many means but his most convenient means is to open portals by playing a song from his Portal Songbook*2 
- He can sooth a rowdy crowd with some of the songs from the book but if he every uses the Portal Songbook he describes it as 'and old book' and keeps the magic subtle and most importantly unnoticed
- He's searching for Magic Thread*3 but also needs the Diamond Needle*4
