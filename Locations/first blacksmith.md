  - Four or five anvils
  - Be using up to three hammers on one anvil
    - The actual smith person himself
    - Two other people with hammers assisting him on that anvil
      - They heat up the initial metal billet

      - The blacksmith would be turning in as well as hitting it, to show them where he wants it to be hit
- At least one blacksmith 
- One or more apprentices, depending on size
- Water trough (and a close water source)
