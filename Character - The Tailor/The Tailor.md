# The Tailor
- He's great at sewing
- He introduces himself as 'A humble travelling tailor' bowing extravagantly probably
- Could possibly meet Tom to the West in the land of giants where The Tailor has arrived from another dimension "How did you get here?" - Tom would ask. "I'm not entirely sure" (true as dimensional re-entry is safe but random) and he might add "It's rather confusing" (true as multi-deimensional travel is rather confusing. 
- Tom would be impressed that The Tailor has a coin
- The Tailor has a confusing array of coins and currency which he may be sorting through as he meets Tom, finding suitable currency for this his home dimension
- The Tailor is informal and relaxed and always polite
- Because Tom is so impressed with seeing a coin she probably doesn't 
- Considerate and conversational in favour of others
- Says very little except idle upbeat conversation
- Is understated when urgent or danger afoot
- He's a great hairdresser but will never mention it because he doesn't ever brag, but he does re-adjust Toms hair
- When arriving at taverns he's always up to his arms in women and friends by the end of the evening
- Never offends anyone
- He knows the tales and specifics of magic items 
- He has a light sword akin to a foil or rapier, and is an exceptional sword fighter with a dandy style
- He will negotiate with you in good spirits while fighting and hope to end up drinking or singing or both
- Too often he will know people at taverns sometimes because of a prior adventure
- He's an amazing dresser
- He probably won't be tied down to arranged times, but always turn up at the right time. It's like he desnt like being boxed in or something
- Eeiry timing

Always presents himself as a humble tailor.. but actually he is secretly an inter-dimensional bard

- He plays the lute and has a Lute of Unfolding*1 while he never transforms in public, but is often seen playing an 'old haggard looking lute'
- He travels interdimensionally by many means but his most convenient means is to open portals by playing a song from his Portal Songbook*2 
- He can sooth a rowdy crowd with some of the songs from the book but if he every uses the Portal Songbook he describes it as 'and old book' and keeps the magic subtle and most importantly unnoticed
- He's searching for Magic Thread*3 but also needs the Diamond Needle*4
- He's discrete to a fault with his knowledge of magic and magical items

Notable Possession:

His cool clothes and sword is visible. Possibly 'an old worn lute' but it's not always visible about his person. Otherwise he is discrete to a fault about his magical possesions.

1. Lute of unfolding

   This is a three inch wooden figurine of a lute which on command unfolds into a masterwork lute that looks old and worn. The same command folds the old lute back into the figurine

2. Portal Songbook

   A beautifully bound and scripted book containing sheet music and transposed phrases and variants used to open portals to new locations, the past, future and other dimensions. But music magic is extensive and this book also holds a variety of songs and spells unrelatedto travel.

   This is unbreakable thread. It's the only type of thread that can be used to repair Magic Waistcoats, Magic Belts, Magic Boots, etc

4. Diamond Needle
