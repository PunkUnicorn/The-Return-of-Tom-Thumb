# The Tailor

## Origin
Brought up in a circus he mastered all acts very quickly, sewing being a peripheral skill underpinning the circus flamboyance and flair. The circus also meant he met many crowds and people, and knew of the towns and trails. Having learnt all he could from his circus family, and with knowledge aquired from talking to the many circus goers, he travelled to fabeled places aquiring key wonderous items umong them the portal songbook.. which opened his world to teleportation, time travel and inter-dimensional hopping. There are numerous other songs in the portal songbook that are unrelated to travel, for a variety of effects.

However the types of travel have not had quite the results he expected.

The teleportation is useful but only works safely when teleporting to a /well known location/. While experementing he has teleported himself into a lake, several feet above the ground, on a prison roof, too close to a cliff edge, and other dangerous places.

Interdimensional hopping is as safe as it gets of the three types of lateral travel. He often goes to other dimensions but will not rush to invite others, since other dimensions are hard on others sanity and The Tailor is too considerate to pull others into that.

Time travel has caused major grief and lost love, since to calculate the composite musical phrase to incrementally go back (to times previously travelled to) requires more intricate and complex musical phrase transposing with looping variations... The Tailor travelled from his time to the future and returned to give his love a wonderful gift, and back to the future to get a better present, and back again to his own time but each time the music got more and more complex. He ventured into the future a third time but has not been able to return home. For a long time he has been stuck in the future. He is stranded, unable to recite the exponentially unfolding lengths of complex symphony to enable the journey back to his own time, as no one can even stay awake that long even if they have the skill to play it. 

In his new time, previously, he had used his items and magic to solve problems but quickly it went wrong, and he got too famous too quickly. He had to jump forward in time again which is where he meets Tom.

He doesn't ever burden others with his sad story. He doesn't time travel any more. He won't teleport to an unknown place but in an emergency he may well teleport them all back to a town they've spent days travelling from. But he will remain as secretive about his available powers and magical capacity, because he knows it is the folly of man that is the curse on the item, if an item is magical the  power amplifies the folly. Sometimes the lack of quick solution is the reason well thought out plans comes about. Learning the hard way he measures twice and cuts once.

He finds going by as a tailor puts him in better social standing than the other circus skills. Not that he judges others like this, it's just the better social status gives him more options while travelling around.
