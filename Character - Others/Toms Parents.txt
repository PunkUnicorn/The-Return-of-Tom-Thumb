Toms Parents
Tom and her brothers have idiot parents. All the children are as illiterate as their probably inbred parents. They are lazy and headonistic, any work the father does is easisly traded for booze which dulls their existance.

The father is violent and brutal but predictable, and mostly generally ignoring his brood. They are only hard work when he looks so they are mostly invisible.

Despite the fathers violent nature the children find a way to avoid getting their fathers attention, learning to live around him mostly unscathed.
