# Croconosaurus

![o hai just eatin ur rock](/Croconocerous/o_hai_just_eatin_ur_rock.png)

Little is known about this most fearsome of creatures except it is rumoured it is half crocodile half rhinoceros. It has also been rumoured to be half of alot of something and half of a lot of something else.

On the 'Change Curve' the Croconocerous is never past blame, going back to shock. 

- i.e. Normal 'Change Curve':

   * Shock => Denial => Blame => Self Blame => Bargening => Resolution
   
   * Croconocerous 'Change Curve': Shock => Denial => Blame => Self Blame => Shock => Denial => Blame => Self Blame => Shock => Denial => Blame => Self Blame => Shock => Denial => Blame => Self Blame => Shock => Denial => Blame => Self Blame => etc

But it isn't edgy with it's blame or what-not. It's 'salty' or dryly sarcastic. Facetious if possible]

## Possible Origin:
*note: see origin story in another file!*
[The oldest known story](Croconosaurus%20-%20origin.md)

The Croconocerous lives in the salty forest exhiled by the Croconocerous' for being too grumpy. Stuck in the salt forest makes this Croconocerous even more grumpy and delirious with thirst. Any carnage caused by this beast is because it hasn't had a nice drink of water. It may have destroyed a village or two but really likes to hide away.

It's hidden away for thousands of years which is why nothing is known

It's got big shy puppy dog eyes but still doesn't want to be anyones friend even if they give it a nice drink of water. It's not aggressuive, rather more Emo. 

"Will you be our friend now?" would say someone after going to great lengths to get it a nice drink of water

If it's huge then it needs a huge drink of water but whatever engeneering or logistical effort anyone goes to will not be appreciated.

Even if it's normal sized but has a supernatural thurst it will not appreciate the effort gone to getting that volume of water.

Perhaps the Croconocerous has a diamond needle stuck in its side. Or perhaps it has diamond needles comming out its ears ..because it's always attacked with diamond spears. Or both.

Diamond needles stuck in it's side and diamond needles comming out its ears.

> It doesn't want to talk about diamomd needles and interupts them
>  shaking it's head angrily and diamond needles fall out.
  
Talking about diamond needles with the Crocosourous will make it go away to have to be alone because diamond needles are the Croconocerous' biggest problem
