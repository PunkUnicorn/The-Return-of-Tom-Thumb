A Croconosaurus “Tale”

(As translated from the tablets of “ancient Hadriel” by “Majalofalic the occasional”, one summers day. 
* Parts marked __unreadable__ either missing or damaged.)

1) 

  O, Croconosaurus of Fable, 
  
	the noble beast of ancient Hadriel,

	trusted and without dispute,

	you knew the ways of the Hag’n’rahoot.

2)

  Keeping us safe both knight and day,
  
	and in the spaces and in-between,

	for so many wondourous days,

	in your company did we gleem!

3)

  So all seemed well and right and good,
  
	but then one day on a Spike we stood.

	For even in our lofty ways,

	temptation came and it made us sway…

4)

  Those days where long and relaxed and breezy,
  
	but some got bored & stood un-easy.

	They spoke of finding something new,

	then darkness came & twisted their view…

        Oh woe to us for these

                  Foolish few!
        
5)

  Taboos were broken and lines were crossed,
  
	our morals they were mostly lost,

	all to have a new thing to eat…

        The Croconousaurus!
    
6)

  At first it was but just a few,
  
	then before much time had passed,

	most all our people had dined on it,

	the flavour was un-surpassed…

7)
  So addictive was this brand-new taste,
  
	that non did pause or ask…

	“What about our old, loyal friends,

	The Croconosaurus?”.

8)

  So it was, it came to pass,
  
	we all ate of it’s meat.

	Blinded by our appetites,

	the betrayal was complete.

9)

  Though Croconosaurus he hoped,
  
	this thing not long to last,

	our hunger did go on and on,

	our appetites so vast.

10) 

  Until the oldest, biggest, wisest,
  
	and most Fearsome of the beat,

	did turn upon his masters,

	with both claw and tooth and beak!

11)

  So strange was it for him to harm,
  
	the people of this land,

	that tears did flow as he attacked,

	to make his mighty stand.

    (it has been said that trees did grow,
    
                  where they hit our sand)
                    
12)

  Then with crashing feet and snarling breath
  
	and swish of might[y] tail,

	the people of all Hadriel did learn to

	fear and wait!

            Much woe did come upon us,
    
            for we realised our fait...
      
13) 

  As if a spell had broken,
  
	the mist cleared before our eyes,

	no more a lie to hide behind,

	avoid this thing so vile.

14)

  Then our wisest mages did convene,
  
	to cast a spell so deep,

	to take us all far from this land,

	into a fold to keep.

15)

  A place to learn and live and grow,
  
	seek wisdom, light and peace,

	no more to harm our fellow beings,

	kill man or fish or beast.

            unreadable
    
16)

  He noble beast now all alone,
  
	did wonder for a while.

	seeing oceans deep and lands afar,

	mile after mile.

17) 

  His hope so strong, now growing weak,
  
	for not a glimps was caught,

	of his breatheren he had hoped to find,

	perhaps all lost or slaught?

18)

  With heavy heart, he journeyed back,
  
	to the forest of the salt.

	his home of old, his place of birth,

	to forget how he had fought.

19)

  There he found beneth the trees,
  
	some comfort of a sort,

	and held inside a glow of hope,

	for happiness time-brought.
