All four heros are present
Tom has established an identity as an 'adventurer', a title made in jest by The Tailor

------------8<-------------[ cut here ]---------------------------


The Knight un-pompasly, objectively shares his perspective that he's the leader of the group. 

Red says "Uh excuse me, 'I' 'm the leader"

Tom says "I'm following him" nodding towards The Tailor

The Tailor says "Whu? I'm not leading anyone!" he turns back to Tom "I'm just a 'Guide'" he says with some gravitas that a guide might have. "Anyway I thought this was your adventure, adventurer" landing it back to Tom.

Tom quirks her eyebrows defensively; she has no sense or desire for authoritative power.

The Knight observes "Hmm well perhaps we have no heirachical structure here, perhaps the idea of a leader, as such does not quite fit to our situation." 

The Knight is silent deep in thought, readjusting something but wrestling; his brow furried.

There's a pause. Red says:

"I was right the first time."

"And it's my adventure"


Summary:
Nothing was learnt
