All four heros are present
Tom has established an identity as an 'adventurer', a title made in jest by The Tailor

The Knight un-pompasly, objectively shares his perspective that he's the leader of the group. 

Red says "Uh excuse me, 'I' 'm the leader"

Tom says "I'm following him" pointing to The Tailor

The Tailor says "Whu? I'm not leading anyone!" he turns back to Tom "I thought this was your adventure, adventurer", he adds.

Tom quirks her eyebrows defensively; she has no sense or desire for authoritative power

The Knight observes "Hmm well perhaps we have no heirachical structure here, perhaps the idea of a leader doesn't quite fit to our situation.

There's a pause. Red says:

"I was right the first time."

"And it's my adventure"

Nothing was learnt
