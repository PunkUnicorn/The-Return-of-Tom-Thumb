All four heros are present

The Knight un-pompasly shares his perspective that he's the leader of the group.

Red says "Uh excuse me, 'I' 'm the leader"

Tom says "I'm following him" pointing to The Tailor

The Tailor says "Whu, I'm not leading anyone!" he turns back to Tom and adds "I thought this was your adventure" (since he has had his fill and is with Tom on Toms quest, which Tom would describe herself as 'an adventure!' so this breaking of 4th wall should be ok)

The Knight observes "Hmm well perhaps we have no leader"

There's a pause.

Red seems satisfied with this and says 
"I was right the first time."

"And it's my adventure"
