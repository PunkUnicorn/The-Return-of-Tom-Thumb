# The Knight

He is the crown prince. 

* Terrorfying social affliction 

   The Knight is accross between his royal highness King Edward VIII and his majesty King George VI: King Edward VIII abdicated and was succeeded by stammering King George VI. The Knight is abdicating due to terrorfying social shyness, inspired by King George VI except The Knight does not have a stammer. Also The Knight is more like King Edward VIII in that he is the prime successor, and King George VI had the social awkwardness but did not abdicate, unlike The Knight.

   Here is [Colin Firth and The Kings Speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHTZWMr0xn8) Oscar winning* portrayal of this terrorfying awkward affliction. The Knight does not have a stammer but this terror is equatable. (*Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role). 

* Systemic madness

   The Knight (or rather The Prince) is too sincere in his perception of court tradition and law sees only madness:
      
      * Archaic madness legislated
      
      * It will never change
      
      * Complicated behemoth of court traditions and laws brutally imposed
      
      * Frankly incorrect 
      
      * Unchangeable dogma
      
      * No critical thinking and little mercy
      
      * Balances of power depend on the status qup
      
      * There is no hope of change without risk of war, uprising or upsetting the geo-political landscape
      
      * He just wants a quiet life


The stone of the palace walls were deeply cold. The Knight looked out of the arrow slit to see the dusk lit expance of the city. His pack was ready, he was in the formal knight's robes with standard knight armour. He had his 'letter from The Prince' safe on his belt: his disguise complete. Putting on the heavy visor was a strange confort; it's weight a reassurance: it will be a good a disguise as it is heavy.

There would be no-one on the south stair from the lower tower at this time, his passage would be unnoticed. Sure enough, dispite the noise him and his pack made, his exit through the south tunnels was observed by nobody.

Each step through the tunnel brought a sharp rememberance of what he was walking away from: ascention, state, being beholden to an ancient archaic machine that needs a puppet. Why be edjucated? why be well read. It makes the puppet role of King so much more crueler for the person in the crown; no free will, no personal judgement, beholden to hundreds of years of history. 

And after the rememberance of the life left behind, there was also a flash of what layed ahead: The open road, a life of freedom; to look and smell, and hear and read. The expansive world and the treasure of ones own selfish curiocity.

And another step remembering the disapointment of his sick father, of his younger sister left to inherit the crown... unprepared; the burden forced onto her.

But again the life away from dogmatic duties, from sicophantic dignitories, petty dukes.
