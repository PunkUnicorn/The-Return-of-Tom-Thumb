# The Knight

He is the crown prince. 

The Knight is accross between his royal highness King Edward VIII and his majesty King George VI: King Edward VIII abdicated and was succeeded by stammering King George VI. The Knight is abdicating due to terrorfying social shyness, inspired by King George VI except The Knight does not have a stammer. Also The Knight is more like King Edward VIII in that he is the prime successor, and King George VI had the social awkwardness but did not abdicate, unlike The Knight.

Here is [Colin Firth and The Kings Speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHTZWMr0xn8) Oscar winning* portrayal of this terrorfying awkward infliction (*Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role)
