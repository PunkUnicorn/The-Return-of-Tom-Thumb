# The Knight

He is the crown prince. 

* Terrorfying social affliction 

   The Knight is accross between his royal highness King Edward VIII and his majesty King George VI: King Edward VIII abdicated and was succeeded by stammering King George VI. The Knight is abdicating due to terrorfying social shyness, inspired by King George VI except The Knight does not have a stammer. Also The Knight is more like King Edward VIII in that he is the prime successor, and King George VI had the social awkwardness but did not abdicate, unlike The Knight.

   Here is [Colin Firth and The Kings Speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHTZWMr0xn8) Oscar winning* portrayal of this terrorfying awkward affliction. The Knight does not have a stammer but this terror is equatable. (*Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role). 

* Systemic madness

   The Kngiht (or rather The Prince) is too sincere in his perception of court tradition and law sees only madness:
      
      * Archaic madness legislated
      
      * It will never change
      
      * Complicated behemoth of court traditions and laws brutally imposed
      
      * Frankly incorrect 
      
      * Unchangeable dogma
      
      * No critical thinking and little mercy
      
      * Balances of power depend on the status qup
      
      * There is no hope of change without risk of war, uprising or upsetting the geo-political landscape
