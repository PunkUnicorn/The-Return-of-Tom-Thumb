# The Knight

He is the crown prince. 

* Terrorfying social affliction 

   The Knight is accross between his royal highness King Edward VIII and his majesty King George VI: King Edward VIII abdicated and was succeeded by stammering King George VI. The Knight is abdicating due to terrorfying social shyness, inspired by King George VI except The Knight does not have a stammer. Also The Knight is more like King Edward VIII in that he is the prime successor, and King George VI had the social awkwardness but did not abdicate, unlike The Knight.

   Here is [Colin Firth and The Kings Speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHTZWMr0xn8) Oscar winning* portrayal of this terrorfying awkward affliction. The Knight does not have a stammer but this terror is equatable. (*Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role). 

* Systemic madness

   The Knight (or rather The Prince) is too sincere in his perception of court tradition and law sees only madness:
      
      * Archaic madness legislated
      
      * It will never change
      
      * Complicated behemoth of court traditions and laws brutally imposed
      
      * Frankly incorrect 
      
      * Unchangeable dogma
      
      * No critical thinking and little mercy
      
      * Balances of power depend on the status qup
      
      * There is no hope of change without risk of war, uprising or upsetting the geo-political landscape
      
      * He just wants a quiet life


The stone of the palace walls were deeply cold. The Knight looked out of the arrow slit to see the dusk lit expance of the city. His pack was ready, he was in the formal knight's robes with standard knight armour. He had his 'letter from The Prince' safe on his belt: his disguise complete. Putting on the heavy visor was a strange confort; it's weight a reassurance: it will be a good a disguise as it is heavy.

There would be no-one on the south stair from the lower tower at this time, his passage would be unobserved. Sure enough, dispite the noise his pack and him made, his exit through the south tunnels went unnoticed.

Each step through the tunnel brought a sharp rememberance of what he was walking away from: the responsibility of an heir to the throne, the state, and the honour of his lineage. The shame on his shoulders. 

And after the rememberance of the life left behind, there was also a flash of what layed ahead: The open road, a life of freedom; to look and smell, and hear and read. The expansive world and the treasure of ones own selfish curiocity.

And before the next step remembering how he would be beholden to ancient archaic feudal court, that needs a puppet at the top to complete the control. And why have an edjucated king? It makes the crown so much more crueler; no personal judgement permitted, beholden to hundreds of years of history.

And another step remembering that his own escape would disapointment his sick father. His younger sister would be left to inherit the burden; unprepared, the heavy crown falling on her...

More steps, faster. But hurrying did not abate the remorse. Regret pushed against guilt. He flashed a thought of regret: not preparing a tourch for this tunnel escape. He had packed a bundle of tourches (he had packed everything he could think of actually).

"I could stop and get the tourches out..." he thought, mentally navigating through the layers of compacted equipment to where the tourches were packed. He knew where everything was, each item compactly packed. But also he might be out of the tunnel soon. It was hard to tell in the dark.

More steps forward but mis-placing his footing tempered his speed; he calmed to a slower pace. 

A draft of air, the tunnel must conclude soon. "Am I doing the right thing?" he felt anxious. He stopped. The weight of his choice tipping back and forth; his stomache churning.

The breeze stronger, biting his face cold, and the sound of rushing. He stopped. It was the sound of rain. Listening. Somehow the prospect of rain was exhillerating. The long routes north, the new experience: isolated villages and towns, the open road. It was dangerous out there and this added to the exhilleration. He could cross the rain into his new life. There was no rain for an heir to the throne. Welcome to his new life: starring rain and regret.

He had prepared thouroughly; studied and investigated the range of possible dangers: bandits were prevelant north on the isolated trails, a criminal network is growing. There are always desparate people. 

A knight of the crown would have little problem passing through civilised dwellings. It was the perfect disguise. As for bandits... he could take them on. But strength in numbers: hoping to latch onto a group already travelling northwards, and travell with them.
