# The Knight

* He is encumbered. His pack has everything you need sooner or later.

* He is encumbered. With anxiety of being restricted by:

   * crushing pointless routine based on 
      * corrupted tradition
      * pride of status and power in previously reigning:
         * Lords
         * Dukes
         * Petty kinglets 

   All of this through the ages turning the foundations of tradition to a mockery of pomp and shallow, short-sighted power-play

   Soul destroying to be beholden to rotten traditions, never to be reviewed.
   
   Beholden to madness.

* He is encumbered. With unfiltered perception of how the world is.

* He is encumbered. With a drink problem.


# Character Arc

As the story progresses The Knight becomes unencumbered. This will happen as a combination of:

 * Gradually on his own terms

   Reviewing each cut case by case. The review is different as the story progresses depending on The Knights Perspective.
   
 * Things break 
 * Dropped of fell off an over-packed rucksack 
 * Stolen lol
 * Anything else
