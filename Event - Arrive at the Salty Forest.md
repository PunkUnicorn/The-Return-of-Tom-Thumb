  [x] All heros are present  
  [x] They have just arrived at the Salty Forest
  
  The salty forest doesn't look salty, but everything growing there strangely, and highly illogically, tastes of salt. There would be a strange crunch under-foot.
  
  Tom would notice this first by noticing leafs and shrubs, feeling and licking as she goes being close to the earth; having been raised feral in the forest.
  
  Someone would say something, possibly because of the strange crunching as they walk on the grass.
  
  Tom would explain, everything is really salty here; trees, grass, brambles... everything.
  
  Someone would ask how she knows: she explains "I've licked a few things."
  
  Summary:
  A bit of Tom will be feral forever.
