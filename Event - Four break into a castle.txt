Yeah the four break into a castle that would be cool

This could be told by the characters after the event as they make sense of what's happened. They thought the duke of the castle, a minor infrastructural official, was INSERT SOME REASON HERE

Red could tell the story, which would have exagerated violence and action. Possibly a song and dance routine. Romance would be gratuitously plonked somewhere.
