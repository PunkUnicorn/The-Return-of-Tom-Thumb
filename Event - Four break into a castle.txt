Yeah the four break into a castle that would be cool

This could be told by the characters after the event as they make sense of what's happened. They followed a cave to escape Roc*1 attack or something. Following the cave which has a draft, they find it follows into a neglected man-made network of tunnels with doors and rooms. There are rats (possibly the rat king?) and minor quests like a 1st lvl dungeon game. Then they go up a level till they break into the civilised castle, but they don't know where they are.

Red could tell the story, which would have exagerated violence and action. Possibly a song and dance routine. Romance would be gratuitously plonked somewhere.

Then The Knight would summarise the whole encounter in a matter of fact way telling the blunt truth of the story and being more acutely aware of their mis-understanding and surprise at accidentally breaking into a castle. They might have made it to the towers before they realised they weren't in danger. 

The lower forgotten dungeons they entered from were dangerous but once they got into the civilised part, but the official dungeon part of the castle, the underlayers where its grim and grimey, dangerous and dark. Guards and inmates might have been mis-interpretted as monsters from the lower dungeon the companions had just come from.

The knight negociates good faith with the duke who owns the castle and they just about got away with it.

Summary:
Nothing of value was learnt
Reds perspective is shown and dramatised
The Knights objective bluntness is shown
