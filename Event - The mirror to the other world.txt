There's a mirror which is a portal to a parallel dimension. Acts like a mirror though, because what ever you're doing, they're doing. You can't get through because yourself from another dimension is blocking you doing exactly the same. 

But the world through the portal they are all slightly different.

You can't pass equipment through for the same reason a person can't get through.

There is glass between them which makes it look like a mirror but if the glass is shattered then the shattering things bounce off each other.

The Knight might take the opportunity to shave, the best mirror he's ever seen. He might have trouble with the conept of portals referring to it as a magic mirror, although The Tailor would confirm there is a magic mirror, that was a portal to a parallel universe. The Knight might scoff.

Red might just about trust her other-self but probably wouldn't trust her companions other-selves.

And they can't ask their other selves questions because they're all saying the same thing at the same time. The Tailor will have a close and knowing relationship with his other-self, with respect and affection. But Red and The Knight would be perturbed. Tom would follow The Tailors lead and descide she does love herself.

Tom couldn't see her other-self but she realises that's because she's hiding. She steps out together.
