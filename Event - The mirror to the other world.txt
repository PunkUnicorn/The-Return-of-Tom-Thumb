There's a mirror which is a portal to a parallel dimension. Acts like a mirror though, because what ever you're doing, they're doing. You can't get through because yourself from another dimension is blocking you doing exactly the same. 

But the world through the portal they are all slightly different.

You can't pass equipment through for the same reason a person can't get through.

There is glass between them which makes it look like a mirror but if the glass is shattered then the shattering things bounce off each other.

And they can't ask their other selves questions because they're all saying the same thing at the same time.

Tom would follow The Tailors lead and descide she does love herself.
