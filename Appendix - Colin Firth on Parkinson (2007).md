# Colin Firth Interview on Parkinson (2007)

Colin Firth says
> I think the secret  [well..] the effect of good writing or  any good story telling is that it makes you feel that it's about you, even if it's set in out of space or 18th century france [etc] you feel it's telling your story. This is everyones story; everybody has a father or rather figure and everyone will loose this person and everyone will have a conflict in that relationship

- Firth talks to Parkinson about what makes a good story. 
- Seems to be some good detail on **Atonement With The Father** stage of Cambell's *The Heros Journey*
