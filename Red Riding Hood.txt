Red Riding Hood
Is devastatingly beautiful 
Doesn’t need to prove anything to anyone
Is the daughter of a woodcutter 
Her woodcutter father is a powerful criminal underworld boss
Her fathers gangster network curries opposition against the kings tax collectors, but the gansters impose their own oppression
Spoilt and snobby she is on the posh side of common
Daddys girl
Cliquey and well connected although she doesn’t share and the clique is exclusive
Selfish and bright enough to be considerate but is often not. When she is considerate it is reluctantly 
She’s feared by those who know of her family's reputation (none of this group does)
But Red Riding Hood is not evil, she just has an evil family. She’s just a girl doing her thing
She probably doesn’t know she’s running illegal anti-lynthrocope medication in her basket
She always carries her basket. ‘It’s goodies for my grandmother’
She’s not strong or good at fighting but when threatened she will let her mouth off and you might wonder that she is actually tough, due to her upbringing by daddy the gangster who would do her fighting for her while growing up

Possibly should be Red Ridinghood not Riding and Hood
