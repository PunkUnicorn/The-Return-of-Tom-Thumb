After recovering his breath, Kim moved up alongside his sister. Tom acknowledged him, her imaginative train of thought evaporating with the eye contact.

They walked towards the village at a slow pace, absorbing everything, every sight, sound and smell:  a hotchpotch of dogs, geese, carts and horses; stacks of things by the buildings; sacks of things by the stacks; smoke wafting; banging of tools; clattering of utensils. Suddenly a shout reverberated above it all.  But it was nothing to do with them. And then the people – how they were dressed: everyone had good boots or clogs. Tom gave her own boots a quick look. Pride surged through her with a dawning thought: she fit in here.

Tom peeked a check at Kim: he looked perturbed, as if the whole thing had been a bad idea. Tom turned to face her brother, her expression inviting him into her excitement. Kim returned her look, but it was clear he was not affected by her. Instead, she saw only dread etched onto Kim’s face.

Suddenly there was someone behind them: “You two are new”, the person said. Tom and Kim stopped abruptly and turned: there was a fair haired boy. A bit older than them. He was holding a cow tethered by a nose ring. “Where you from?”. The boy glanced between Tom and Kim, but his gaze settled on Tom.

Kim barely said a thing, only murmuring a low greeting in a tone of slight disapproval.

But Tom answered eagerly, “Hello.”; she was pleased for a new friend.

“We’re from The Forest.“. She pointed north by way of explanation.

“Oh.” said the boy, as if he were interested. “The Forest.” he nodded in agreement. But then an awkward pause hung in the air, before he continued.

“What you come down here for?”

Kim looked to Tom; Kim had no idea.

Tom realised this was it: her chance to conduct business. “I’ve come to sell apple pips.”

Another pause hung for a moment as the boy pondered Tom’s words.

“Oh.” said the boy, attempting to mask his doubt.

Tom produced one of the giant pips, holding it in her outstretched palms for the boy to see, “Look!”

The boy gaped in astonished silence at her offering.

“That’s not right,” he admonished after a while. “Who else you shown that to?”

“No one, you’re the first,” came Tom’s quick reply.

“Where’d you get that from then?” the boy asked, adding, “I’m Jack, by the way.”

“Nice to meet you Jack, I'm Tom. We got it from a giant apple.”

Jack did not seem to notice her greeting which was her favourite part. Instead he asked: “What you planning on doing with it?”

Tom was sure she had answered this already. “I want to sell it.”

“Oh.” said Jack. “What for?”, quickly clarifying, “How much you asking for it?”

Kim interrupted, demanding: “A cow.”

Jack challenged a question back: “A cow?” He was incredulous; looking around the sky, barely containing chortles.

“Come on.” said Kim to Tom, grabbing her as he took firm steps away, towards the village hubbub.

“No!” burst Jack, “Wait!”; his interest in the pip confirmed.

Kim stopped but kept his grip on Tom, her jumper stretching as she turned to Jack: “I’ve got three.”

“Oh!” exclaimed Jack, as if this changed everything, “Three! why didn’t you say so?”

Kim was not convinced. Without hesitation he turned away, pulling Tom with him.

“Alright, alright. The cow for the pips,” Jack negotiated, “but only for all three of them.”
