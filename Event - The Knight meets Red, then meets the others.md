 -- [x] It's early on and The Knight has not met anyone yet
 -- [x] Neither has Red
 -- [x] Tom and The Tailor are experementing with the boots, leaping forward south arriving where Red and The Knight are travelling north
 
 ## Call to adventure
 
Red is prolonging an errond for the sake of more free time alone, doing what she wants away from the protection of her powerful father.
 
The Knight is the crown prince disguised as an errond knight, for the sake of freedom to do what he wants.
 
Red is between vilages travelling north on an isolated trail. The Knight is travelling north likewise, and recognises Red since she is a local celebrity; her father, The Woodcutter, having slayed the dreaded wolf. She is also famous for her dancing shows. 

They are both sort of lieing to each other. both escaping something, but they eaisily accept each others cover stories as to why they are travelling north.
 
## Refusal of the call

The Knight is seeking travelling company (safety in numbers), and presumes the role of protector. Red would be sensative towards this, not needing protection; she is escaping protection. 

He may misinterpret her refusal of protection as a show of her own prowess, but she can't fight and doesn't need to, being the daughter of the criminal overlord. She would leave The Knight believing what he want's, it makes no difference to her; she has nothing to prove.

However, Red would see The Knight as a great accessory. It is The Knight who is seeking strength in numbers, so it would seem, in a way, Red is protecting The Knight. She wonn't hesitate to point this out. The Knight would understand this, and since this new logic works to the same conclusion; strength in numbers, they would travel together happily getting something from the others presence.

## Supernatural aid

They meet Tom and The Tailor who have been experimenting with Toms boots travelling far far south. Tom is probably half sleeping, half delirious (the effect of boot leaps) and The Tailor would be making her comfortable.
