# Chapter One

 <sub>Once upon a time in a land far away,</sub>
 
 <sub>Children were lost, by their parents betrayed,</sub>
 
 <sub>They encountered a house, a good place to stay,</sub>
 
 <sub>But giants lived there, pursuit under way!</sub>
 
 <sub>Boots were stolen, a giant was slayed,</sub>

 <sub>The children escaped, hip, hip hooray.</sub>
