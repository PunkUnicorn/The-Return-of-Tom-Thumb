The Forest
This expansive forest is the home of Tom Thumb. If it had a name no one in Toms family knew it. It went on forever to the north and the same east and west as far as anyone dare go in those directions. To the south is the town on the edge of the forest (its name is Baskel).

It has scrawney squirels, and scrawney foxes. Deep to the north there are rumours of scrawney wolves and scrawney dear but no one knows for sure. The forest is left untaimed, rotten trees falling often and dead wood unmaintained is a major peril with little warning before it falls.
