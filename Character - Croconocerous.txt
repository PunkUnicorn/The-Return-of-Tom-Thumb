Little is known about this most fearsome of creatures except it is rumoured it is half crocodile half rhinoceros

Possible Origin:
The Croconocerous lives in the salt forest exhiled by the Croconocerous' for being too grumpy. Stuck in the salt forest makes this Croconocerous even more grumpy and delirious with thirst. Any carnage caused by this beast is because it hasn't had a nice drink of water. It may have destroyed a village or two but really likes to hide away.

It's got big shy puppy dog eyes but still doesn't want to be anyones friend even if they give it a nice drink of water. It's not aggressuive, rather more Emo. 

"Will you be our friend now?" would say someone after going to great lengths to get it a nice drink of water

After a tiny amount of thought the Croconocerous would turn to them 
with its puppy dog eyes 
and reply
"No"

Perhaps the Croconocerous has a diamond needle stuck in its side. Or perhaps it has diamond needles comming out its ears ..because it's always attacked with diamond spears. Or both.

Diamond needles stuck in it's side and diamond needles comming out its ears.

Also not to put too fine a point on it,
to the Croconocerous diamond needles
are a pain in the arse.

It doesn't want to talk about diamomd needles and interupts them
  shaking it's head angrily and diamond needles fall out.
  
Talking about diamond needles with the Crocosourous will make it go away to have to be alone because diamond needles are the Croconocerous' biggest problem
