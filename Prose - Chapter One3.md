After recovering his breath Kim moved to join his sister. Tom acknowledged him, her train of thought gone with the eye contact.

They walked towards the village at a slow pace to absorb everything: sights, sounds and smells, geese, dogs and people. Carts and horses. Stacks of things by the buildings. Sacks of things by the stacks. Smoke, banging. A sudden shout, but nothing to do with them.

And how people were dressed. Everyone had good boots or clogs. Tom gave her own boots a quick look. Pride enveloped her with a dawning thought: she was fitting in.

Tom peeked a check at Kim: he looked perturbed, as if the whole thing was a bad idea. Tom turned to face her brother inviting him into her excitement. Kim returned her look but it was clear he was not influenced. Instead Kim echoed his dread.

“You two are new” said someone behind them. The two stopped and turned abruptly: a relaxed, fair haired boy. A bit older than them. He was holding a cow by a nose ring tether. “Where you from?“ the boy glanced between Tom and Kim, but ended on Tom.

Kim barely said anything, a slight disapproval for a greeting.

“Hello.” Tom answered eagerly, pleased for a new friend. “We're from The Forest.“ She pointed north to explain.

“Oh.” said the boy as if he was interested. “The Forest.” he nodded and a pause brewed. 

“What you come down here for?” he asked.

Kim looked to Tom; Kim had no idea.

Tom realised this was it, her chance to conduct business. “I've come to sell apple pips.”

There was a pause but this one did not brew; it dropped.

“Oh.” said the boy after some thought.

“Look.” said Tom, pulling out one of the giant pips, holding it in her outstretched palms for the boy to see.

The boy looked at her offering, but after no time he was astonished. Which accompanied his silence. 

“That's not right.” He said after a little time. “Who else you shown them to?” He added.
