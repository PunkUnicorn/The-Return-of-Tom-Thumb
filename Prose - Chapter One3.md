After recovering his breath Kim moved to join his sister. Tom acknowledged him, her train of thought gone with the eye contact.

They walked towards the village at a slow pace to absorb everything: sights, sounds and smells, geese, dogs and people. Carts and horses. Stacks of things by the buildings. Sacks of things by the stacks. Smoke, banging. A sudden shout, but nothing to do with them.

And how people were dressed. Everyone had good boots or clogs. Tom gave her own boots a quick look. Pride enveloped her with a dawning thought: she was fitting in.

Tom peeked a check at Kim: he looked perturbed, as if the whole thing was a bad idea. Tom turned to face her brother inviting him into her excitement. Kim returned her look but it was clear he was not influenced. Instead Kim's face echoed his dread.

Suddenly there was someone behind them: “You two are new”, someone said. Tom and Kim stopped abruptly and turned: there was a relaxed, fair haired boy. A bit older than them. He was holding a cow by a nose ring tether. “Where you from?”. The boy glanced between Tom and Kim, but ended on Tom.

Kim barely said anything, a slight disapproval for a greeting.

But Tom answered eagerly, “Hello.”. She was pleased for a new friend. “We’re from The Forest.“. She pointed north to explain.

“Oh.” said the boy as if he was interested. “The Forest.” he nodded, and a pause brewed. 

“What you come down here for?” he asked.

Kim looked to Tom; Kim had no idea.

Tom realised this was it, her chance to conduct business. “I’ve come to sell apple pips.”

There was a pause but this one dropped.

“Oh.” said the boy after some thought.

“Look.” Tom produced one of the giant pips, holding it in her outstretched palms for the boy to see.

The boy saw her offering but after no time he was astonished, which was accompanied by silence.

“That’s not right.” He said after a little time. “Who else you shown that to?” He inquired.

“No one, you’re the first.” Tom’s quick reply.

“Where’d you get that then?”, the boy asked adding “My name’s Jack by the way.”

“A giant apple.” she answered. “Nice to meet you Jack.”

Jack did not seem to notice her greeting which was her favourite part.

“What you planning on doing with it?” Jack asked.

Tom was sure she had answered this already. “I want to sell it.” 

“Oh.” said Jack. “What for?” quickly clarifying, “How much you asking for it?”

“A cow.” Kim demanded.

“A cow?” Jack challenged, incredulous. He looked around the sky barely containing chortles.

“Come on.” said Kim and took firm steps towards the greater village hubbub, his hand grabbing Tom.

“No!" burst Jack, "Wait!", his interest in the pip confirmed.

Kim stopped but kept his grip on Tom, her jumper stretching as she turned to Jack: “I’ve got three.”

“Ah!” said Jack as if this changed everything. “Three! why didn’t you say so?”

Kim was not convinced. Without hesitation he turned away, pulling Tom with him.  

“Alright, alright. The cow for the pips,” Jack negotiated, “but only for all three of them.”
