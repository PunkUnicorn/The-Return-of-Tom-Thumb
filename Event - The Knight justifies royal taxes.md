- [x] All companions are present
- [x] They haven't met the Croconocerous yet

The companions from the north (Tom, The Tailor) either have never heard of the Croconocerous or don't believe in it.

Those from the south (Red, The Knight) have heard of it and possibly believe in it. Nobility is certain of it's existance and the tax collected by the king is re-invested into anti-croconocerous methods: extending walls, armies, etc

The Knight is convinced the Croconocerous exists and Red thinks it probably does. Tom's never heard of it and The Tailor believes it's a mythical creature but with a surprising number of references in folklore.

The Knight is surprised because the castle has collected all available folklore on the Croconocerous, and there isn't much. How does The Tailor know?

The Tailor excuses this as a memory for songs and tales [he's from the past, it's tradgic and complicated but this is how he knows it] but he would perhaps sing one:

MAKE UP A CROCONOCEROUS POEM


Summary:
- Nothing was learnt
