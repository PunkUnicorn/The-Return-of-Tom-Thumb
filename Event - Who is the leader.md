- [x] All four heros are present
- [x] Tom has established an identity as an 'adventurer', a title made in banter; a Tailor coinage
- [x] The companions are really two groups of two (Tom & The Tailor, Red & The Knight) but accidentally group together. This is set at the start of this transition (probably after their first Event)

The Knight is not pompous. He objectively shares his perspective that he's the leader of the group. 

Red says: 
> "Uh excuse me, I'm the leader."

Tom says:
> "I'm following him" 

...nodding towards The Tailor.

The Tailor says: 
> "Whu? I'm not leading anyone!" 

He turns back to Tom:
> "This is your adventure."

Tom quirks her eyebrows defensively; she has no sense or desire for authoritative power.

The  Knight observes: 
> "Hmm well perhaps we have no branched structure here? Perhaps the idea of a leader, as such, does not fit our situation?"

The Knight is silent, deep in thought. His brow furried; readjusting something, looking for the structure.

There's a pause. Red says:

> "I was right the first time."

> "Yeah, and it's my adventure."


Summary:
- Nothing was learnt.
