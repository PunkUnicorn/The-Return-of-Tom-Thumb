- [/] All four heros are present
- [/] Tom has established an identity as an 'adventurer', a title made in jest by The Tailor
- [/] The companions are really two groups of two (Tom & The Tailor, Red & The Knight) but accidentally group together. This is set at the start of this transition (probably after their first Event)

------------8<-------------[ cut here ]---------------------------


The Knight un-pompasly, objectively shares his perspective that he's the leader of the group. 

Red says: 
> "Uh excuse me, 'I' 'm the leader"

Tom says:
> "I'm following him" nodding towards The Tailor

The Tailor says: 
> "Whu? I'm not leading anyone!" 
He turns back to Tom 
> "This is your adventure."

Tom quirks her eyebrows defensively; she has no sense or desire for authoritative power.

The  Knight observes: 
> "Hmm well perhaps we have no heirachical structure here, perhaps the idea of a leader as such does not fit to our situation." 

Th e Knight is silent deep in thought. Readjusting something but wrestling; brow furried.

There's a pause. Red says:

> "I was right the first time."

> "And it's my adventure"


Summary:
- Nothing was learnt
