In a large semi-circle cavern cave, in the middle of this cave, on a stone plinth is a mirror. It has a stone frame fixed to the plinth.

There's a mirror which is a portal to a parallel dimension. But it's not a mirror, it's a portal. Acts like a mirror though, because thes divergence between the parallel dimension through the portal and this one is the parallel dimension is left handed. What ever you're doing, they're doing. You can't get through because yourself from another dimension is blocking you doing exactly the same. 

But the world through the portal their clothes are all slightly different colours, inverted versions of their colours. Perhaps different features. Perhaps some other more significant differences. Meh, anyway ehem. Nothing so different they could get through.

You can't pass equipment through for the same reason a person can't get through.

There is glass between them which makes it look like a mirror but if the glass is shattered then the shattering things bounce off each other.

The Knight might take the opportunity to shave, the best mirror he's ever seen. He might have trouble with the conept of portals referring to it as a magic mirror, although The Tailor would confirm there is a magic mirror, this was not it. This one was a portal to a parallel universe. Both Knights might scoff while shaving. The Knight would probably insist it's a magic mirror and continue to shave.

The Tailor would pace round the mirror looking at the edges. He might murmer as he examines it. He might try and explain further to the group, but conclude out loud that he may as well be talking to himself, to his other-self. 

Red might just about trust her other-self but probably wouldn't trust her companions other-selves.

And they can't ask their other selves questions because they're all saying the same thing at the same time. The Tailor will have a close and knowing relationship with his other-self, with respect and affection. But Red and The Knight would be perturbed. Tom would follow The Tailors lead and descide she does love herself.

Tom couldn't see her other-self but she realises that's because she's hiding. She would step out of the shadows together with her other-self.

The cave is empty apart from the mirror. There's no other clue in the cave, the whole thing is a mystery.

Summary:
- Characters relationship with themselves explored
- Water bouncing off the portal is cool, rocks thrown are cool. Trying to get the tip of a sword through is cool. Touching your own hand is wierd.
- It's actually quite boring, but quirky. Lots was learnt but none of it useful
