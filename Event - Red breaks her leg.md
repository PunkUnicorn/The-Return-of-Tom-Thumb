LOOKS LIKE A BRIDGE EVENT

Red breaks her leg (?by climbing down the rope ladder from the balloon powered by music, from the return to the giants house event, and falling?)

She deals with it in good spirits, and accomodates; without using it as an excuse. It's cast by whoever has the highest heal skill (which turns out to be Tom. The others don't have any ranks in heal. But this all makes sense.)

This might be the injury that is ultimately healed by the stone of power event

Summary:
Red soldiers on with no fuss.
