# Chapter Three

Kim held the tether of the cow. Tom waved Jack farewell, who was keen to depart after the transaction. Tom wished Jack had been more social instead of hurrying off. She felt dissatisfied.

Tom scanned the village hoping to see something that would cascade her enthusiasm. However, the sun was lower in the sky and the crowds had thinned; the day was retiring. She had sold the pips, there was no reason left to stay.

“We'd better head back.” suggested Kim.

Tom was not ready for this. She found an excuse, a reflex born from desperation: “The trail will be dark. Shouldn't we wait till first light?”

Kim looked to the cow, who was even less keen to hurry than Tom. He sighed, and did not instantly disagree. Tom could see in Kim's face he had not given up: “Why don't you make your boots 'go fast'?” he counteracted, accusing.

At this exact moment another traveller was walking past. Tom saw him, a well dressed young man with a bright spotless shirt. Handsome, relaxed and wearing suave boots. Something caught his attention. 

He flashed an awkward glance towards Tom, but averted a connection. However, Tom had to answer Kim.

But let us switch to the perspective of this handsome, relaxed traveller.

As he approached the two he thought: “How odd; a pair of urchins in rags. One of which with impeccable boots.”.

And, this traveller thought, how did they get to be holding Jack's cow? The hasty lad Jack had been trying to sell it for too much coin; he seemed desperate, but would not change his mind on the price. “I wonder?” he thought, on all counts. 

As he passed the scruffy pair, seeing Jack's cow and hearing: 'make your boots go fast', he was more than curious. On his months long journey there had been nothing interesting for leagues. 

Glancing at the one with the boots he could see it was a girl not a boy. She wore boys clothes that were too big for her, except for her adult male boots. Which looked tailored. This was the point that he almost caught Tom’s eye. She noticed his glance, so he looked away, not wanting to intrude. 

He walked past them; he had to assess the road ahead.

Using the remaining light to see ahead, the long road north was sparse. Also he reckoned it was more bitterly cold, and he had heard it was dangerous further up. 

As he walked he made a choice: he would stop, turn around and head back south from where he came. It had been an ambitious venture starting the previous spring. The seasons spent travelling north had reached their conclusion, here at this spot.

He slowed his steps. There was nothing in front of him. Behind him the two (with the cow) were arguing: the girl did not want to get lost in the forest, the boy wanted to get home; the girl said “The boots didn't work like that.”, the boy getting a little frustrated. Her final gambit: to plead caution, for fear of getting lost. The boy seeming to be swayed. They stopped talking. 

Our well dressed travelling man slowed to a stop, and turned around. He could see the strange two with the cow. He was behind them. The cow faced him however.

He took a few steps towards them. They were silent. He stopped a little too far away; giving them adequate space. He introduced his presence with a polite cough. They turned around. The man bowed slightly, moderately spreading his hands; a gesture of openness. 

“Greetings.” he said smiling shyly, more shyly than his snappy clothes and confident posture would suggest.

“Hello.” Tom beamed. Kim stayed silent.

“Could, I... possibly ask you... one hundred billion things?” the well dressed man begged as much as unruffled composure would allow.

Tom laughed; this smart, handsome figure fooling around. Kim snorted out enough to give away he found it funny.

“Firstly,” continued the man, “please allow me to introduce myself: I am a humble tailor.” and he bowed slightly.

“I'm Tom.” she completed, and then continued with a question: “A tailor?”, she asked impressed. And then more earnestly: “Do you really want to ask questions?”

The Tailor took a step forward, nodded to confirm, “Yes.” He paused. “If I could ask one thing that I am curious about: did you buy that cow off that lad Jack?”

Tom was proud of buying the cow; one of her proudest achievements: “Yes.” but she noticed The Tailor was concerned: “Why?”.

The Tailor looked at Tom with regret, gently stating: “All day Jack was asking a rather high price.”, but Tom did not understand. The Tailor seemed to notice, breaking the slight pause by continuing: “I wondered if...  would you share how much the cow cost you?”. The Tailor was aware this was a rude question, but felt concern for the pair.

Tom shrugged: “Three apple pips.“. The Tailor was confused but after some questions he understood: they were from a giant apple. Tom would not share where the apple came from. In fact, she seemed to shut down when asked; she started shrinking away. 

The Tailor would liked to have asked more questions. He wanted to correlate giant apples and strange boots against stories he had known. But The Tailor needed to ask questions to gather more facts. Instead the girl was talking less, lips sealed and looking frightened.

To re-engage the girl he diverted the conversation to tales of his own travels from the south. This woke Tom up, but not the other one: her brother he presumed.

Tom pressed questions about the south: it's commerce, on cosmopolitan values. Each answer was too much for her to grasp, and yet the questions were numerous. The Tailor answered as best he could.

Kim interrupted, slightly angry: “It's cold.”. Tom and The Tailor stopped talking and silently agreed with him, yet they could have talked more. 

The Tailor had not satisfied his curiosity, there was still too much about the girl Tom that was a mystery. 

Tom was equally enthralled by The Tailor. The places he had seen; he seems to have seen the whole world! This man was friendly, easy to talk to. Unlike Jack, The Tailor would listen to what she said.

He took an interest in her questions, and was gentle with her misunderstandings. She felt invigorated. 

Listening to his tails of travels and antics, Tom built a picture in her mind of towns further south: of people and lifestyles, how others lived and the wonders of life outside the forest.

Kim ignored the two while they were talking. All the time he had been wondering how the town's people choose which building to sleep in. He was expecting to fight for space, but he was not sure how it worked here.

The Tailor did not notice how unaccustomed these two were to town life: “Let’s get to the inn.”, and they followed him.

Walking slowly (at the pace of the cow) The Tailor was certain of his direction. The building of their destination was obvious by the noise, music and loud voices. 

The Tailor gestured towards the cow: “I doubt she will be allowed inside.”, adding to the cow: “Sorry old girl.”. Turning to Tom and Kim, his palms facing them; asking them to wait: “I’ll talk to the innkeeper and see if we can stay in the barn.”

Tom wondered what an innkeeper was. She built an imaginary picture of a large man. He had a solid club and a serious agenda. She did not want to get the attention of the innkeeper. So she did as The Tailor suggested; stopped and waited. Kim seemed to have reached the same conclusion.

The Tailor opened the door erupting layers of noise and the smell of warm food. There was bread and gravy in there. Suddenly Tom was aware of her hunger. This encouraged her to consider peeking inside. These instincts battled against the image of the innkeeper. 

The door opened, this time gravy with laughter. The Tailor had returned. “We can stay in the barn tonight,” he reported cheerfully. “it’s this way, follow me.”, and they followed him to around the other side of the inn. 

The barn door swung open easily (and silently). Inside was a large barn offering fresh hay and no horses. It was dark but The Tailor could just about make out the finest barn he thought he had ever seen. “Well...” he exclaimed, stopping dead in his tracks. “This thorpe might be one of the grottiest hovels, but they have the finest barns.”.

Tom was stunned to silence at the sight of the space and the luscious piles of hay. Tom saw that Kim had found a close corner section. She layed claim to the equal corner opposite and The Tailor joined Tom's side, both having ample space. 

The Tailor sat briefly but got up quickly, fumbling at his sides then reaching up on tip toes towards something dangling. Grunting he pulled this down and something above rattled. Tom saw a rope swinging in and out of the edge of the open barn door. 

“Ahh” shared The Tailor; as if this answered something. A spark of light illuminating The Tailors face and the dangling thing became a lantern. The barn was lit with a soft flickering glow. 

The Tailor closed a door on the lantern then cautiously let go as if he was not sure it would float. He walked towards the massive open door watching the lantern. It swung from the long rope anchored to the roof.

Watching the lantern The Tailor reached towards the rope, letting it swing into his hand. Gently pulling, the lantern lowered slightly. He laughed curtly and looked towards the rope, taking hold of a second higher rope next to the first. 

Pulling this caused the lantern to rise, which rose to above the Tailors head hight. Then it stopped and The Tailor stared at the dangling lantern. It swung strangley, having been agiteted. Tom liked the entertainment, seeing something swing from a long rope. It suddenly lowered then stopped suddenly. 

Tom looked towards The Tailor who was grinning. He pulled on the other rope and the lantern rose to it's previous origin, just as quickly. “I love that.” He concluded. “The inkeeper said it housed more people in than horses. I doubt people actually travel to this place.” looking around. “It would explain a lot.”

Suddenly The Tailor turned towards the door; “I have to settle up with the innkeeper,” he remembered, “and get us some food, I'm really hungry.”. He left quickly.
