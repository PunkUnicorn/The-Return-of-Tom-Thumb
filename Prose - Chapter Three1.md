# Chapter Three

Kim held the tether of the cow. Tom waved Jack farewell, who was keen to depart after the transaction. Tom wished Jack had been more social instead of hurrying off. She felt dissatisfied.

Tom scanned the village hoping to see something that would cascade her enthusiasm. However, the sun was lower in the sky and the crowds had thinned; the day was retiring. She had sold the pips, there was no reason left to stay.

“We'd better head back.” suggested Kim.

Tom was not ready for this. She found an excuse, a reflex born from desperation: “The trail will be dark. Shouldn't we wait till first light?”

Kim looked to the cow, who was even less keen to hurry than Tom. He sighed, and did not instantly disagree. Tom could see in Kim's face he had not given up: “Why don't you make your boots 'go fast'?” he counteracted, accusing.

At this exact moment another traveller was walking past. Tom saw him, a well dressed young man with a bright spotless shirt. Handsome, relaxed and wearing rather good boots. Something she and her brother were saying caught his attention. He flashed an awkward glance towards Tom, but averted a connection.

Let us switch to the perspective of this handsome, relaxed traveller.

He thought: “How odd; a pair of urchins in rags. One of which with impeccable boots.” 

And how did they get to be holding Jack's cow? The hasty lad had been trying to sell it for too much coin; he seemed desperate, but would not change his mind on the price. “I wonder?” he thought, on all counts. 

As he passed the scruffy pair, seeing Jack's cow and hearing one of them talking about 'make your boots go fast' he was more than curious. 

On his months long journey there had been nothing interesting for leagues. Glancing at the one with the boots he could see it was a girl not a boy. She wore boys clothes that were too big for her. She noticed his glance, so he looked away, not wanting to intrude. 

He walked past them; he had to assess the road ahead.

Using the remaining light to see ahead, the long road north looked sparse. Also he reckoned it was more bitterly cold, and he had heard it was dangerous further up. As he walked he made a choice: he would stop, turn around and head back south from where he came. It had been an ambitious venture starting the previous spring. The seasons spent travelling north had reached their conclusion, here at this spot.

So he slowed his steps. There was nothing in front of him. Behind him the two (with the cow) were arguing: the girl did not want to get lost in the forest, the boy wanted to get home; the girl said “The boots didn't work like that.”, the boy getting a little frustrated. Her final gambit: to plead caution, for fear of getting lost. The boy seeming to be swayed. They stopped talking. 

Our well dressed travelling man stopped and turned around. He could see the strange two with the cow were still there. He was behind them. The cow faced him however.

He took a few steps towards them. They were silent. He stopped a little too far away; giving them adequate space. He introduced himself with a polite cough. They turned around. The man bowed slightly, moderately spreading his hands as a gesture of openness. 

“Greetings.” he said smiling shyly, more shyly than his snappy clothes and confident posture would suggest.

“Hello.” Tom beamed. Kim stayed silent.

“Could, I... possibly ask you... one hundred billion things?” the well dressed man begged as much as unruffled composure would allow.

Tom laughed; this smart, handsome figure fooling around. Kim snorted out enough to give away he found it funny.

“Firstly,” continued the man, “please allow me to introduce myself: I am a humble tailor.” and he bowed slightly.

“I'm Tom.” she completed, and then continued with a question: “A tailor?”, she asked, impressed with this. And then more earnestly: “Do you really want to ask questions?”

The Tailor took a step forward, nodded to confirm, “Yes.” He paused. “If I could ask one thing that I am curious about: did you buy that cow off that lad Jack?”

Tom was proud of buying the cow; one of her proudest achievements: “Yes.” but she noticed The Tailor was concerned: “Why?”.

The Tailor looked at Tom with regret, gently stating: “All day Jack was asking a rather high price.”, but Tom did not understand. The Tailor seemed to notice, breaking the slight pause by continuing: “I wondered if...  would you share how much the cow cost you?”. The Tailor was aware this was a rude question, but felt concern for the pair.

Tom shrugged: “Three apple pips.“. The Tailor was confused but after some questions he understood: they were from a giant apple. Tom would not share where the apple came from. In fact, she seemed to shut down when asked; she started shrinking away. The Tailor would liked to have asked more questions, to correlate against stories he had known. Instead he worked hard, diverting the conversation to tales of his own travels from the south. This woke Tom up, but not the other one: her brother he presumed.

Tom pressed questions about the south: it's commerce, on cosmopolitan values. Each answer was a bit too much for her to grasp, and the questions were numerous. The Tailor answered as best he could. 

Kim interrupted, slightly angry: “It's cold.” Tom and The Tailor stopped talking and silently agreed with him, yet they could have talked more. The Tailor had not satisfied any curiosity, there was still too much about the girl Tom that was a mystery. And what about this giant apple?

Tom equally was enthralled by this travelling tailor. The places he had seen; he seems to have seen the whole world! The Tailor was friendly, easy to talk to. Unlike Jack this man would listen to what she said. He took an interest in her questions, and was gentle with her mis-understandings. She felt invigorated talking to him. 

Listening to his tails of travels and antics, Tom built a picture in her mind of towns further south: of people and lifestyles, how others lived and the wonders of life outside the forest.

Kim ignored the two while they were talking. All the time he had been wondering how the town people choose which building they are going to sleep in. He was expecting he would have to fight for space, but he was not sure how it worked here.

“Lets get to the inn.” The Tailor did not notice how unaccustomed these two were to town life, but they followed him. They walked slowly at the pace of the cow, The Tailor certain of his direction. As they approached the building of the destination, Tom could hear music and loud voices inside.
