# Chapter Six

“Here it is.”, The Tailor pointed towards the town ahead. Tom wanted to stop and rest but The Tailor sped up. “I need to see the smithy, get a few things while we're here.”, but he did not mention the smell of old vegetables.

Somebody slumped on the floor against the side a building blocked their path. “He's drunk.”; The Tailor explained, as they maneuvered single file around him.

Weaving through accidental alleyways, squeezing past competing buildings, they startled rats which darted away in panic. Judging by the size of the rats, Tom knew people ate well. That combined with the stentch of discarded food.

Leaving the maze of buildings, they entered a muddy clearing which soon led to a high, intimidating wooden wall. The Tailor knew where he was going, but walked across the clearing, straight towards it. But then Tom could see a door; it blended into the wall very well. She could hear a crowd on the other side, and as The Tailor opned the door, the combined sights and sounds hit them.

Bustling people shuffled around market stalls. The stalls themselves stretched into the distance. What looked like an oppressive wall on one side was less impressive the other. It stopped short, in ruins, before it could even make a semicircle around the market.

The Tailor stepped to one side and raised an arm to pause Tom. He looked across the stalls. Somewhere, someone was cooking chicken, and a further away, over the sound of the crowd, a piper played. Suddenly, somebody near them shouted. Quickly glancing up, Tom saw the shouter had found his quarry and it had nothing to do with them. The Tailor took a deep breath: “This is where trappers and miners meet.”, he said regretfully. “Let's get this over with.”

Tom walked directly behind The Tailor; it was easy following him step for step through the crowd. Attention all but lost to the busyness around, each stall a world of it's own. One had arrays of dried meats, its neighbour: a stall displaying increasing sizes of metal hoops. Long, thin, wooden poles lay next to them. Tom wondered what these were for?

The other side of the muddy walkway, through a happenstance gap in the crowd, a vendor surrounded by bolts of multicoloured, satin cloth. He was arguing with a rotund customer. Someone behind them laughed. The cloth merchant raised his shrill voice; it pierced through the crowd in a language Tom did not understand.

But they hurried past him and all the distractions, towards a steady metallic banging. It had just started, pulses of three. Each hit rattled the back of Toms teeth, but it's echo played a beautiful tone. “Oh good,”, The Tailor exclaimed, “he's in residence.”. 

The Tailor extended his arm towards Tom, “Climb up.”, and Tom scrambled up The Tailor's side to his shoulders, easily finding steps up along his side. The view was an image she would never forget: the variety of people, clothes, and fully ladened trestle bench stalls. The crowed bobbed, a sea of heads. A group of fine hats, with shimmering feathers, standing out in the crowd. Next to them, a small group of shaggy haired, roughly fur-clad men.

From The Tailors shoulders she traced the sound of the banging: a large circular brick building in the center of the market, thick smoke plumed from it's chimneys.
