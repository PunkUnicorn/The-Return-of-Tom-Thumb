# Chapter Six

All this time while The Knight and Red had met, wandereed northwards together, and stopping to make their camp in the thicket clearing, Tom and The Tailor were travelled southwards.

“Here it is.”, The Tailor pointed towards the town ahead. Tom wanted to stop and rest but The Tailor sped up. “I need to see the smithy, get a few things while we're here.”, but he did not mention the stench of rotting vegetables.

Somebody was slumped on the floor in front of them, vaguely against the side of a building; stretched out, blocking their path. “He's drunk.”, The Tailor explained and they manoeuvred single file around him.

Weaving through alleyways, made from competing buildings, they startled rats which darted away panicked. Judging by the size of the rats, and the smell of the rotting food, Tom knew that the people here ate well.

Leaving the maze of buildings they entered a muddy clearing, which soon led to a high, intimidating wooden wall. The Tailor seemed to know where he was going but walked straight towards the wall. But then Tom could see a door which almost blended into the wall. She could hear a crowd on the other side. As The Tailor opened the door, Tom was inundated with a bewildering array of sights and sounds.

Bustling people shuffled around market stalls, stretching into the distance. What looked like an oppressive wall on one side stopped short, in ruins, before it could even make a semicircle around the market.

The Tailor stepped to one side pulling Tom with him. He looked across the stalls, she could smell chicken being cooked. Further away, over the sound of the crowd, a piper played a frantic series of scales. Somebody shouted at them. Tom quickly looked up, but it had nothing to do with them, it was for somebody else. The Tailor took a deep breath: “This is where trappers and miners meet.”, he shared, regretfully. “Come on, let's get this over with.”

Tom fell in behind The Tailor, it was easy following his steps through the crowd. Her attention lost to the busy businesses around, each stall an entire world. One had many hanging, dried meats. Its neighbour: a stall displaying increasing sizes of metal hoops, with long, thin, wooden poles laying next to them. Tom wondered what these were for?

On the far side of the muddy walkway, through a happenstance gap in the crowd, a vendor, surrounded by tall bolts of multicoloured cloth. He was arguing with a rotund customer. Behind her somebody burst out laughing. But the cloth merchant's shrill voice pierced through, angry in a language she did not understand.

Hurrying past, they walked towards a steady, metallic banging. It had just started; pulses of three. Each hit rattled the back of Tom's teeth, but its echo played a beautiful tone. “Oh good, he's here.”, The Tailor exclaimed. He extended his arm towards Tom, “Climb up.”, and Tom scrambled up The Tailor's side to his shoulders, easily finding steps. 

The view was spectacular, an image she would never forget: the variety of people, clothes, fully laden trestle bench stalls. The crowd bobbed, a sea of heads. She traced the sound of the banging: a large circular stone building in the center of the market, thick smoke plumed from it's chimneys. They walked towards it.

At the blacksmith's entrance The Tailor did not break stride to pass under the doorway. Instead, he squatted mid-stride, and Tom cricked her neck sideways. Inside, The Tailor stopped; flinching from the heat. For a moment Tom thought her lips might burn.

In front of them stood three men around an anvil. One hammered a glowing strip of metal; it shot angry sparks in defiance with each hammer blast, but the blacksmith's leather aprons took the angry sparks impassively. The three blacksmiths were focused on their their task, they didn't react to Tom and The Tailor or seem to noticed them.

The Tailor stood there watching them from where he was standing, immediately inside the doorway. Tom wanted him to move, they were both blocking the doorway. She fought a rising anxiety being conspicuous and bold in the space The Tailor chose. She slowly slid off The Tailor's shoulders behind him, as out of sight as possible. Two people approached as she landed on the floor, she partially watched: a large, burly man and a tall thin boy who straddled just behind him.

“Hello again”, The Tailor said cheerfully to the burly man.

He responded with a grunt. “You’re back again. I suspected you were an idiot. But now I know you are.”

“I couldn’t stay away”, The Tailor explained, shrugging. The burly man responded by snorting a curt laugh. He was about to say something else but the three at the anvil started banging again, which interrupted him. He gestured to the thin lad, who left, then herded Tom and The Tailor back outside through the doorway. The bright dazzling sun and sharp cold wind were stark contrasts to the dim, hot workshop.

The burly man flinched, squinting from the light but not the chill as he raised his bare, scarred arms to shield his face from the sun. “So admit it idiot, you’re lost.”.

“No.” and The Tailor gazed over the market town, as if assessing it for the first time. “I obviously came back to admire your town and your face again. Perhaps make an oil painting of them. That and your fabulous inn.”. He jerked a thumb behind him, pointing to the filthy Inn on the other side of the wide trail behind them.

The burly man snorted, “Then we’ve got some whores you should meet. Paint *them*. That and my fat hairy arse.” He brought a small, wooden pipe to his eye, squinting inside. He rapped it twice, sharply against the building’s wall.

“We won’t stay long though.” The Tailor added, “Just a quick pass-through holiday this time.” Tom listened to The Tailor’s words. She knew he was being sarcastic. But to her, it was a holiday.

The burly man extended his arm, pointing behind them. Tom and The Tailor turned. “Look, one of the local holiday sights:”, The burly man dryly captioning a staggering drunkard, half-tripping out of the Inn’s door. The drunk man recovered his steps and slowed his walking. But then stopped. He seemed unsure for a moment. But then he was sure and quickly bent forward, dropped to his knees and vomited along the path in front of him. The splattering went far along down the path.

The burly man looked back towards the pipe in his hand. He pinched leaves from a small leather pouch in the other. He glanced a nod towards the drunkard: “Looks like you’ve got a rival artist.”

The Tailor laughed.

The burly man and The Tailor continued to exchange dry, insulting jibes. That, and sarcastic commentary on the comings and goings around them. She found the sarcasm strenuous, being unfamiliar with the targets of satire. The sarcastic tones of voice misleading. Solid information, that she tried to grasp, elusive. 

She turned to look at the burnt-out wall. The banging chimes from the smith rang beautiful echoes around the market. The noisy bustle from the crowd occasionally accented by laughs from The Tailor and his friend. She had no idea what they were talking about any more, but it made her smile.
