# Chapter Six

"Here it is.", The Tailor pointed towards the approaching town. Tom wanted to sit down but The Tailor was speeding up: "I need to see the smithy while we're here,", Tom offered a blind nod of agreement, "and we're going to need a few things."

The two of them hurried past somebody slumped on the floor against the wall of a building. "He's drunk.": explained The Tailor, "We'll see the smith first.", then adding behind a hand, as if telling a taboo: "he's the nicest person here."

But there was nobody else to be seen as Tom followed The Tailor through a crooked, almost accidental ally. Rats darted away while competing buildings spared the narrowest of walkways. By the size of the rats Tom knew people here did not go hungry.

The Tailor led them out of the maze, into a long clearing in front of a high wooden wall. He seemed to know where he was going, through a broken door in the wall. The other side: a vibrant market with wide, muddy walkways. What looked like an oppressive wooden wall as they had approached it suddenly, from the other side, looked sorry for itself as it stopped short, in ruins, before it could even make a semicircle around the market.

He stepped to one side, raising an arm to pause Tom, and looked across the evenly spread stalls in front of them. Somewhere chicken was being cooked, and a further distance away a piper played. Suddenly, somebody near them shouted, but it was nothing to do with them. The Tailor took a deep breath: "This is where trappers and miners meet.", he said regretfully. "Let's get this over with."

Tom matched The Tailors steps; it was easy following him through the crowd. The stalls either side, each one a world of its own; one displaying hanging dried meats, neighboured by a stall of different sized metal hoops, and long, thin wooden poles. Tom wondered what these were for.

Through a hapenstance gap in the crowd, Tom saw a vendor surrounded by bolts of multicoloured, satin cloth. He was argueing with a rotund customer. Someone behind them laughed. The cloth merchant raised his shrill voice. It pierced through the crowd in a language Tom did not understand.

A steady metallic banging echoed from far ahead, pulses of three. Each hit rattled the back of Toms teeth, but its echo a beautiful tone. "Oh good,", The Tailor declared, "he's around.", and he extended his hand towards Tom, "Climb onto my shoulders.", which Tom did, finding steps along him with her tiny feet. 

The view from his shoulders was an image she would never forget for the rest of her life. The variety of people, clothes, and tressle benches laidened, each one with never the same items as the previous. The crowed bobbed, a sea of heads. a group of fine hats, with shimmering feathers, standing out in the crowd, and next to them, a small group of shaggy, roughly fur-clad, men.

From The Tailors shoulders she traced the sound of the banging and saw the smithy, a large circular zone in the center of the market.
