# Chapter Six

“Here it is.”, The Tailor pointed towards the town ahead. Tom wanted to stop and rest but The Tailor sped up. “I need to see the smithy, get a few things while we're here.”, but did not mention the smell of decomposing vegetables.

Someone slumped on the floor against the side a building blocked their path. “He's drunk.”; The Tailor dismissed, as they maneuvered single file around him.

Weaving through accidental alleyways, squeezing past competing buildings, they startled rats. They darted away in panic. Judging by the size of the rats, Tom knew people ate well.

Leaving the maze of buildings they entered a clearing in front of a high, intimidating wooden wall. The Tailor knew where he was going, while waking straight towards the wall. A door became apparent, blending out of the wall, the sound of a crowd on the other side. As The Tailor opned the door the clear, unblocked sound of the crowd hit them.

Bustling people shuffled around market stalls, it stretched into the distance. What looked like an oppressive wall on one side was less impressive the other, as it stopped short, in ruins, before it could make a complete semicircle around the market.

The Tailor stepped to one side and raised an arm to pause Tom. He looked across the stalls. Somewhere, someone was cooking chicken, and a further away, over the sound of the crowd, a piper played. Suddenly, somebody near them shouted. Quickly glancing up, Tom saw it had nothing to do with them. The Tailor took a deep breath: “This is where trappers and miners meet.”, he said regretfully. “Let's get this over with.”

Tom walked directly behind The Tailor; it was easy following him, step for step, through the crowd. Attention all but lost to the busyness around, each stall a world of it's own. One had arrays of dried meats, it neighboured a stall displaying increasing sizes of metal hoops. Long, thin, wooden poles lay next to them. Tom wondered what these were for?

The other side of the muddy walkway, through a happenstance gap in the crowd, a vendor surrounded by bolts of multicoloured, satin cloth. He was arguing with a rotund customer. Someone behind them laughed. The cloth merchant raised his shrill voice; it pierced through the crowd in a language Tom did not understand.

But they hurried past him, and all the distractions, towards a steady metallic banging. It had just started, pulses of three. Each hit rattled the back of Toms teeth, but it's echo played a beautiful tone behind her. “Oh good,”, The Tailor exclaimed, “he' in residence.”. He extended his hand towards Tom, “Climb up.”, and Tom scrambled up to The Tailor's shoulders, finding easy steps up along his side.

The view was an image she would never forget: the variety of people, clothes, and fully ladened trestle bench stalls. The crowed bobbed, a sea of heads. A group of fine hats, with shimmering feathers, standing out in the crowd. Next to them, a small group of shaggy haired, roughly fur-clad men.

From The Tailors shoulders she traced the sound of the banging: a large circular brick building in the center of the market, thick smoke plumed from it's chimneys.
