# Chapter Six

"Here it is.", The Tailor pointed towards the obvious town ahead. Tom wanted to stop and rest but The Tailor was speeding up: "I need to see the smithy,", Tom offered a blind nod of agreement, "we're going to need a few things."

They hurried past somebody slumped on the floor against one of the first buildings. "He's drunk.": explained The Tailor quietly. Tom followed The Tailor through a crooked, almost accidental ally. Surprised rats darted away between competing buildings as the two followed the narrowest of walkways. Judging by the smell of rotting vegtables, and the size of the rats, Tom knew people here did not go hungry.

The Tailor led them out of the maze into a wide clearing in front of a high, intimidating wooden wall. He seemed to know where he was going as he walked straight towards it. A door became apparent, blending out of the wall. On the other side of the door was a vibrant market with wide, muddy walkways. Crowds of people and dizzying spreads of market stalls. What looked like an oppressive wall on one side looked sorry for itself, in ruins, the other side as it stopped, destroyed, before it could make a semicircle around the market.

The Tailor stepped to one side raising an arm to pause Tom. He looked across the evenly spread stalls. Somewhere, someone was cooking chicken, and a further away, over the sound of the crowd, a piper played. Suddenly, somebody near them shouted, but it was nothing to do with them. The Tailor took a deep breath: "This is where trappers and miners meet.", he said regretfully. "Let's get this over with."

Tom matched The Tailors steps; it was easy following him through the crowd. The stalls either side, each booth it's own world; one with an array of dried meats neighboured a stall displaying incresing sizes of metal hoops, and long, thin wooden poles. Tom wondered what these were for.

The other side of the muddy walkway, through a hapenstance gap in the crowd, Tom saw a vendor surrounded by bolts of multicoloured, satin cloth. He was argueing with a rotund customer. Someone behind them laughed. The cloth merchant raised his shrill voice. It pierced through the crowd in a language Tom did not understand.

But they hurried past them all. A steady metallic banging echoed ahead of them, pulses of three. Each hit rattled the back of Toms teeth, but its echo played a beautiful tone behind her. "Oh good,", The Tailor exclaimed, "he's in residence.", and he extended his hand towards Tom, "Climb onto my shoulders.", which Tom did, easily finding steps along his side with her tiny feet. 

The view from his shoulders was an image she would never forget for the rest of her life. The variety of people, clothes, and tressle benches laidened, each one never the same. The crowed bobbed, a sea of heads. A group of fine hats with shimmering feathers standing out in the crowd, and next to them a small group of shaggy, roughly fur-clad, men.

From The Tailors shoulders she traced the sound of the banging: a large circular brick building in the center of the market, thick smoke plumed from its wide chimneys.
