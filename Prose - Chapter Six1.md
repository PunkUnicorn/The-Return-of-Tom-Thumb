# Chapter Six

“Here it is.”, The Tailor pointed towards the town ahead. Tom wanted to stop and rest but The Tailor sped up. “I need to see the smithy, get a few things while we're here.”, but he did not mention the stench of rotting vegetables.

Somebody slumped on the floor against the side a building, blocking their path. “He's drunk.”: The Tailor explained. They maneuvered single file around him.

Weaving through accidental alleyways, squeezing past competing buildings, they startled rats which darted away, panicked. Judging by the size of the rats, and the smell of rotting food, Tom knew people here ate well.

Leaving the maze of buildings, they entered a muddy clearing which soon led to a high, intimidating wooden wall. The Tailor seemed to know where he was going but walked straight towards the wall. But then Tom could see a door blended into it. She could hear a crowd on the other side. As The Tailor opened the door, Tom was inundated with bewildering sights and sounds.

Bustling people shuffled around market stalls, stretching into the distance. What looked like an oppressive wall on one side stopped short, in ruins, before it could even make a semicircle around the market.

The Tailor stepped to one side pulling Tom with him. He looked across the stalls, she could smell chicken being cooked. Further away, over the sound of the crowd, a piper played. Somebody shouted at them. Tom quickly looked up, but it had nothing to do with them, it was for somebody else. The Tailor took a deep breath: “This is where trappers and miners meet.”, he shared, regretfully. “Come on, let's get this over with.”

Tom fell in behind The Tailor, it was easier following his steps through the crowd. Her attention lost to the businesses around her, each stall a world of its own. One had arrays of hanging, dried meats. Its neighbour: a stall displaying increasing sizes of metal hoops. Long, thin, wooden poles lay next to them. Tom wondered what these were for?

On the far side of the muddy walkway, through a happenstance gap in the crowd, a vendor, surrounded by tall bolts of multicoloured cloth, was arguing with a rotund customer. Someone behind them laughed but the cloth merchant stole attention, raising his shrill voice; it pierced through the crowd in a language Tom did not understand.

Hurrying past they walked towards a steady, metallic banging. It had just started; pulses of three. Each hit rattled the back of Toms teeth, but its echo played a beautiful tone. “Oh good,”, The Tailor exclaimed, “he's here.”. He extended his arm towards Tom, “Climb up.”, and Tom scrambled up The Tailor's side, to his shoulders, easily finding steps. 

The view was spectacular, an image she would never forget: the variety of people, clothes, fully ladened trestle bench stalls. The crowed bobbed, a sea of heads. A group of fine hats, with shimmering feathers, standing out in the crowd.

From The Tailors shoulders she traced the sound of the banging: a large circular brick building in the center of the market, thick smoke plumed from it's chimneys.
