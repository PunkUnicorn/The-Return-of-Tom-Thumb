# Chapter Six

“Here it is.”, The Tailor pointed towards the town ahead. Tom wanted to stop and rest but The Tailor sped up. “I need to see the smithy, get a few things while we're here.”, but he did not mention the stench of rotting vegetables.

Somebody was slumped on the floor in front of them, vaguely against the side of a building; stretched out, blocking their path. “He's drunk.”, The Tailor explained and they maneuvered single file around him.

Weaving through alleyways, made from competing buildings, they startled rats which darted away panicked. Judging by the size of the rats, and the smell of the rotting food, Tom knew that the people here ate well.

Leaving the maze of buildings they entered a muddy clearing, which soon led to a high, intimidating wooden wall. The Tailor seemed to know where he was going but walked straight towards the wall. But then Tom could see a door which almost blended into the wall. She could hear a crowd on the other side. As The Tailor opened the door, Tom was inundated with a bewildering array of sights and sounds.

Bustling people shuffled around market stalls, stretching into the distance. What looked like an oppressive wall on one side stopped short, in ruins, before it could even make a semicircle around the market.

The Tailor stepped to one side pulling Tom with him. He looked across the stalls, she could smell chicken being cooked. Further away, over the sound of the crowd, a piper played a frantic series of scales. Somebody shouted at them. Tom quickly looked up, but it had nothing to do with them, it was for somebody else. The Tailor took a deep breath: “This is where trappers and miners meet.”, he shared, regretfully. “Come on, let's get this over with.”

Tom fell in behind The Tailor, it was easy following his steps through the crowd. Her attention lost to the busy businesses around, each stall an entire world. One had many hanging, dried meats. Its neighbour: a stall displaying increasing sizes of metal hoops, with long, thin, wooden poles laying next to them. Tom wondered what these were for?

On the far side of the muddy walkway, through a happenstance gap in the crowd, a vendor, surrounded by tall bolts of multicoloured cloth. He was arguing with a rotund customer. Behind her somebody burst out laughing. But the cloth merchant's shrill voice pierced through, angry in a language she did not understand.

Hurrying past, they walked towards a steady, metallic banging. It had just started; pulses of three. Each hit rattled the back of Tom's teeth, but its echo played a beautiful tone. “Oh good, he's here.”, The Tailor exclaimed. He extended his arm towards Tom, “Climb up.”, and Tom scrambled up The Tailor's side to his shoulders, easily finding steps. 

The view was spectacular, an image she would never forget: the variety of people, clothes, fully ladened trestle bench stalls. The crowd bobbed, a sea of heads. She traced the sound of the banging: a large circular stone building in the center of the market, thick smoke plumed from it's chimneys. They walked towards it.

At the blacksmith's entrance The Tailor did not break stride to pass under the doorway. Instead, he squatted mid-stride, and Tom cricked her neck sideways. Inside, The Tailor stopped; flinching from the heat. For a moment Tom thought her lips might burn.

In front of them stood three men around an anvil. One banged a glowing strip of metal, sparks flying with every ring of the hammer. The other two focused soley on the pliers they held. None of them looked towards Tom and The Tailor, or even noticed them. 

The Tailor just stood there, inside the doorway. Tom wanted him to move. Blocking the doorway, as conspicuously as they were, gave her a rising anxiety. So she slid off The Tailor's shoulders. Two people approached as she landed on the floor behind him. She partially watched; a large, burly man and a tall thin boy straddling just behind him.

“Hello again”, The Tailor said cheerfully to the burly man.

He responded with a grunt. “You’re back again, too soon.”

“I couldn’t stay away”, The Tailor explained. The burly man snorted a curt laugh. The three at the anvil started banging again which interrupted him as he was about to say something. He gestured to the thin lad, who left, then herded Tom and The Tailor back outside through the doorway. The bright dazzling sun and sharp cold wind were stark contrasts to the hot, dim workshop.

The burly man flinched, squinting from the light. But not the chill, his scarred arms and shoulders seemingly impervious to the wind. “So admit it, you’re lost.”, he accused The Tailor.

“No, I came back so I could make an oil painting of your Inn.”, The Tailor extended both arms rightwards, at different heights, so to frame the filthy building behind them.

The burly man snorted, “Then we’ve got some whores you should meet. Paint *them*. That and my fat hairy arse.” He brought a small, wooden pipe to his eye, squinting inside. He rapped it twice, sharply against the building’s wall.

“We won’t stay long. Just a quick holiday this time.” Tom listened to The Tailor’s words. She knew he was being sarcastic, but to her, it was sort of a holiday.

“Don’t forget to see the sights.”, the burly man offered, extending his arm to something behind The Tailor. Tom looked, The Tailor twisted around: a staggering drunkard, almost tripping out of the Inn’s door behind them. The drunk man slowed his walking, then stopped. He seemed unsure. But then he was sure, and quickly bent forward, dropped to his knees and vomited along the path in front of him. The splattering went quite far along the path, and down three shallow steps.

The burly man looked back towards the pipe in his hand. He pinched leaves from a small leather pouch in the other. He glance-pointed a quick nod towards the drunkard: “Looks like you’ve got a rival artist.”

The Tailor laughed.

The burly man and The Tailor continued to exchange dry, insulting jibes. That, and sarcastic commentary on the comings and goings around them. She found the sarcasm strenuous, being unfamiliar with the targets of satire. The sarcastic tones of voice misleading. Solid information, that she tried to grasp, elusive. 

She turned to look at the burnt-out wall. The banging chimes from the smith rang beautiful echoes around the market. The noisy bustle from the crowd occasionally accented by laughs from The Tailor and his friend. She had no idea what they were talking about any more, but it made her smile.
