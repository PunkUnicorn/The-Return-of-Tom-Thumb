# Chapter Six

“Here it is.”, The Tailor pointed towards the town ahead. Tom wanted to stop and rest but The Tailor sped up. “I need to see the smithy. We need a few things.”, he said, not mentioning the smell of decomposing vegetables.

Someone was slumped on the floor against the side a building, he blocked their path. “He's drunk.”; explained The Tailor as they maneuvered single file around him.

They weaved through crooked, accidental alleyways made from competing buildings. Startled rats darted away as The Tailor lead Tom through the narrowest of walkways. Judging by the size of the rats, Tom knew people here ate well.

The maze took them into a clearing in front of a high, intimidating wooden wall. The Tailor seemed to know where he was going while he walked straight towards it. A door became apparent, blending out of the wall. The sound of a crowd on the other side, and as the door opened a vibrant market erupted.

Crowds of people moved around spreads of market stalls. They stretched into the distance, as far as Tom could see amongst the crowd. What looked like an oppressive wall on one side was less impressive the other, as it stopped short, in ruins, before it could make a complete semicircle around the market.

The Tailor stepped to one side raising an arm to pause Tom. He looked across evenly spread stalls. Somewhere, someone was cooking chicken, and a further away over the sound of the crowd a piper played. Suddenly, somebody near them shouted, but a quick glance up Tom saw it was nothing to do with them. The Tailor took a deep breath: “This is where trappers and miners meet.”, he said regretfully. “Let's get this over with.”

Tom walked directly behind The Tailor; it was easy following him through the crowd. Stalls either side, each one a world of it's own; Tom saw one with arrays of dried meats. It neighboured a stall displaying increasing sizes of metal hoops. They lay next to long, thin, wooden poles. Tom wondered what these were for?

The other side of the muddy walkway, through a happenstance gap in the crowd, a vendor surrounded by bolts of multicoloured, satin cloth. He was arguing with a rotund customer. Someone behind them laughed. The cloth merchant raised his voice; shrill pierced through the crowd in a language Tom did not understand.

But they hurried past them all. A steady metallic banging echoed ahead, pulses of three. Each hit rattled the back of Toms teeth, but it's echo played a beautiful tone behind her. “Oh good,”, The Tailor exclaimed, “hes in residence.”, and he extended his hand towards Tom, “Climb up.”, and Tom scrambled up to The Tailor's shoulders, easily finding steps along his side.

The view was an image she would never forget: the variety of people, clothes, and trestle benches. Each bench never the same as another, all fully ladened. The crowed bobbed, a sea of heads. A group of fine hats with shimmering feathers standing out in the crowd, and next to them a small group of shaggy, roughly fur-clad men.

From The Tailors shoulders she traced the sound of the banging: a large circular brick building in the center of the market, thick smoke plumed from it's chimneys.
