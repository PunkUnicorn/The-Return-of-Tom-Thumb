The Knight
Unshaven and unkempt, low standards for a 'knight'
Travelling on his own, revealing little to nothing. He will share his direction of travel but not his destination or mission
He lives a life on the road with a backpack to match
Smart, perceptive and a quick however at first and throughout he has a quick nieve mouth which will show The Knights drastic misunderstanding of the world
Snobby, opinionated and cynical (believes his own propaganda) 
Swigs from a jug of ale often
Military training
Well educated but keeps this a secret as part of his disguise and over acts to compensate for not actually being a knight, and only acts how he thinks one of his knight acts
Keeps a secret that he is The Prince on the run disguising himself as one of his knights on an errand
He doesnâ€™t want a stuffy role as an official or any kind of dull responsibility
Initially and typically rude he has a heart of gold
Will happily dual with The Tailor in The Tailors style in good spirits and while The Knight has exceptional training and skill he is no match in this style for The Tailor. However in a 'fair fight' no doubht The Kngiht would win since he is, as his training is, a warrior prince and The Tailor isn't motivated as such. Knights don't normally have such diverse styles so to the perceptive eye this is a clue that The Kngiht is not quite a knight
He's a terrible lier and might try to tell his 'backstory' in a narative style but with awful lies and possibly exaggeration
If encountering other real knights (looking for The Prince lol) The Knight might produce them a letter signed by The Prince authorising The Knight on a quest to search for The Prince if he went missing. Enforcing knights that read this will buy the story and not twig, let The Kngiht pass and possibly re-suply him. The Knight will do this with other knights out of earshot from the group but Tom might be able to sneak up and hide to listen in, overhearing the whole interaction
Strength 17/18, Dexterity 12/18, Constitution 16/18, Wisdom 14/18, Charisma 9/18, Intelligence 16/18

Notable Possession:
Knight plate armour and possably an over-robe 
Knights helmet which he doesn't always wear but puts on when approaching built up areas, or other of the kings knights
Some kind of sword or weapon that's his favouret, and most certainly a standard issue knight weapon thing
Jug of ale
Backpack with all traveling stuff in, on and around it
Official letter from The Prince authorising the knight (bearing the specified seal) free passage on a quest to look for The Prince*1
Bona fide knights signature ring but it is a 'borrowed' antique royal one from an ancient converging bloodline long forgotten*2

*1 This is such a dumb plan using an antique royal signature ring (long forgotten but bona fide) and a letter written by himself as The Prince as part of his disguise as The Knight. However knights aren't the sharpest lances when presented with official letters, so they fall for it hook line and sinker

*2 other knights will recognise this as bona fide but unfamiliar, The Knight will claim he is from the barracks in the far North (somewhere far away from local)
