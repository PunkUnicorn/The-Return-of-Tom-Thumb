Tom gets a chance to claim a prize. Perhaps won from a wondering gypsy. Tom chooses a plain but shiney marble. It is disregarded by the others but Tom has simple tastes and this small shiney stone delights her. So she chooses it over arguably more valued prizes.

Or it's a fixed thing, part of the landscape they are passing. Either a marble or some kind of landscape fixture one of the two.

This stone can transform into a small golden orb, which represents innocence. When alive it becomes a slightly shimmering, slightly floating, small golden ball.

The golden orb can answer introspective questions but the answers are typically questions back, and a close echo of the original question:

Q: "Will I ever escape?"
A: "Will escape"

Q: "Will I ever be happy?"
A: "Be happy"

Q: "Can I ever forgive myself?"
A: "Forgive yourself"

If questions are more objective and external the orb will simply repeat the question:

Q: "Where's the nearest settlement?"
A: "Where's the nearest settlement?"


Tom can interact with the orb, as can The Knight. This is because they still carry some innocence. The Tailor and Red are less fragile, and do not manage to get the introspective answers; just getting repeats of their questions back. Tom and The Knight are both more in-tune with the orb, it glowing more with them both but less with Red and The Tailor.



Summary:
Life goes on.
