They arrive at the first moderate small town.

Red takes them to an inn, its all but empty.

She says 'Stay here' and leaves

They sit on a table for four people.

Tom and The Knight opposite.

The Tailor next to Tom.

Tom is against the wall, the most hidden spot (this is not actually relevant to this story segment)

The Tailor gets nervous because inns like this (empty with muscle behind the bar) are underworld hubs.

They shouldnt be there. The Knight is oblivious, worries if other Knights would come here.

The Tailor says "No" laughs. Explains the situation.

Red comes back and the owner is her uncle. Her father was worried, the uncle shouldn't let her go.

Red says purring delightedly to the others, and her uncle "I'd like to see you try and stop me."

Uncle would laugh, say to the others "She's just like her mother."

Red would say "Look uncle, I have my own little gang."

Uncle sees a fighter, thief and a bard. A bloody adventuring party. But this is never said directly in the prose, but alluded to.

He laughs. Red is a genius he thinks.

Summary:
- Red is a genius
