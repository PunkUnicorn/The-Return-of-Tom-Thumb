  - [x] All four heros are present
  - [x] Set in the tiny village where Tom first met The Tailor, probably coming or going to or from the Expansive Forest
  - [X] They may or may not have met the lady who lives in the giants shoe yet.
  - [X] Tom probably still believes she has slayed the giant.
  
  
  At the town Jack is herralded as a hero, possibly paintings of him on walls of buildings: Jack the giant killer!
  
  Jack uses the status to swagger round like he's the man, abd be as lazy as humanly possible. But this title of giant killer is not without merit; Jack's giant apple pips grew into an eary beanstalk, which grew so fast and so tall that it penetrated the relm of clouds where the giant house sits between phases. The giant chased Jack back down and Jack knocked him out by chopping the beanstalk and making him fall. Jack does not know the giant is alive, from Jacks perspective the giant was killed.
  
  Tom may still think she had killed the giant. Untill now, thant is. 

    Tom thought she killed the giant, but it appears she was mistaken, otherwise how did Jack kill him if he was killed? Therefore, perhaps the giant isn't dead this time either? The Tailor probably thinks of this
