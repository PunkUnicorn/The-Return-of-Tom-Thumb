Tom scooped up a handful of apple flesh, then walked slowly towards the house to finish eating. As she drew closer, the remains of the door latch caught Tom’s attention. It was a mangled, rusted wreck that had once been a latch. Tom had never known it any other way. The latch on the giant’s door was the first functioning one she had seen.

Licking her hands clean, while wiping them dry on her trousers she wondered if their mangled latch could be bent back into shape. But then shadows of anxiety arrived as she remembered how others would react.

Now aware of her family behind the door, defensive instincts pulled her back: stay unnoticed, don’t change the latch; be invisible. Tom closed her mind, stiffened her muscles and pulled the heavy door open.

The overpowering smell of baked apples. The heavy door slammed shut behind her. In the thick air, for a second, Tom was sick of apples. But the feeling quickly passed. She chastised herself for the obvious: the apple being a life saver. Besides, the pips in her pocket could be interesting.

There was no good seat available. Around the table sprawled her brothers, there was only one seat left: the smallest and least sturdy. Tom wanted to sit so she sat there.

Often there were brawls over the precious little they had. Seats (or more specifically seats and seat positions) were a common cause of trouble but Tom avoided this. Once or twice she might have had to fight for the right to be left alone. That was worth fighting for, but little else was.

And yet, bellies full, even mitigated tensions were rising round the table; competing voices. She did not look though, not a time to risk eye contact. She listened to judge tones of aggression: anxiety reassured; it was safe.

Wiggling her toes, squashing them against the leather of the boots, the argueing grew more distant as comfort won the battle for her senses.

The next morning Tom woke earlier than anyone else. With well practised tiptoeing she stepped between sleeping siblings, got to the door and slipped outside. The first thing she saw: brown, leaning apple core.

The dazzling morning sun spared the eye no mercy; the giant apple core was looking far from adequate. Tom realised her expectations had been wrong.

The house door opened quietly behind her, Tom looked round. It was her oldest and biggest brother, Kim. He joined her. 

“You’re up early?”, Kim asked.

Tom wanted to tell Kim of her plan to head to the village and sell the pips. At the same time she did not want to risk an argument. She met his eyes as if to answer, but instead, she did not. Tom looked back towards the apple.

“What you doin’?”, Kim asked.

Tom heard the accusation in the question. She braced her upper body, relaxing her legs; ready to dodge. “I’m going to the village.” reluctantly.

Kim walked a few steps then stopped to pick up a choice stick: a sturdy branch used the previous day by her brothers in high spirits. It was almost as tall as Tom. Kim held it like a staff vertically, its base on the floor.

Leaning his weight against it, it held. He started walking towards the south trail, muttering: “You’re a stupid sod.”. After more steps he inclined his head towards Tom: “Are you coming then?”.

The south trail was easy in comfortable boots. Kim had their father’s hand-me-downs, which were only second generation. They looked more or less like normal old boots. Tom’s pair looked new, but obviously too small for anyone but her and her tiny frame. Early on she had relied on this to stave off others’ desires on the boots.

She strongly suspected they would fit whoever held them, the same way they had for her. She had pulled the boots off the giant very easily, accidentally even, and they had slipped off the giants feet into her hands: a pair of boots exactly the right size for her.

Progress along the south trail was pleasant enough, but they pushed themselves hard with no stopping. The forest thinned and the trail became a road. It was afternoon by the time they began to see the dotted buildings of the village far in the distance. They could be there soon, two more hills to cross. They quickened their pace to Tom's fastest.

By early afternoon the two had reached the village. Kim carried Tom piggy back for the last stretch; he was exhausted. Tom jumped down, fidgeting her legs back to normal. With her feet on the ground and her feeling returning to her like again, she assessed their destination. They had been to this place recently, when fleeing the giants.

Tom saw the collection of buildings as if for the first time; it was dark previously. She could remember the relief on arriving... but then the memories of the nightmare before that, at the giant’s house: the giant trying to kill her.

With a concerted breath, the reassurance of the pips in her pocket and a village full of in front of her, Tom gathered her focus... which, being Tom, took her straight through tunnels into fantasy daydreams: of what the pips could be worth?
