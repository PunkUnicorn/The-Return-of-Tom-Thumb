# Red Riding Hood
Is devastatingly beautiful 

Doesn’t need to prove anything to anyone

Her dancing is legendary across the land

Is the daughter of a woodcutter 

Her woodcutter father is a powerful criminal underworld boss

Her fathers gangster network curries opposition against the kings tax collectors, but the gansters impose their own oppression

Spoilt and snobby she is on the posh side of common

Daddys girl

Cliquey and well connected although she doesn’t share and the clique is exclusive

She knows the right inns and taverns to go to for the 'real scene', and avoids 'tourest taverns' as she would put it

In her known places she will meet her circles of friends which are extensive. 

She's always top-girl in any town, her popularity as a local celebrety. Although typically only 1D4 of these girl-friends would be close enough to be in her inner circle.

She knows all the bandits, beggers and underworld characters because this is her fathers network

She will chat to them fondly asking after their families and afairs. They quite like and trust her AND are terrified of her father

Selfish and bright enough to be considerate but is often not. When she is considerate it is reluctantly 

She’s feared by those who know of her family's reputation (none of this group does)

But Red Riding Hood is not evil, she just has an evil family. She’s just a girl doing her thing

It's possible she's been fed anti-lynthrocope medication possibly not. Might not even be a thing but you know, just sayin'

She always carries her basket. ‘It’s goodies for my grandmother’

She’s not strong or good at fighting but when threatened she will let her mouth off and you might wonder that she is actually tough, due to her upbringing by daddy the gangster who would do her fighting for her while growing up

She will take the oppotunity to learn a light sword style if she sees The Tailors style of fencing. In her eagerness and tenacity to persue this training, would probably drop her guard and show her edgy side to get what she craves... elligant and dexterity based light sword fighting, more powerfull than it looks. It would come in handy while ruling her fathers empire later in life

Strength 7/18, Dexterity 14/18, Constitution 12/18, Wisdom 9/18, Charisma 16/18, Intelligence 14/18


Origin:
Red is the only child of a woodcutter but this woodcutter is a powerful criminal boss. While the king has his knights do tax collecting the money paid as tax never benefits the towns. The woodcutter and his enforcers maintain the infrastructure although they do this with a brutal hand and their own taxation. Reds father is feared and loathed but still his reach grows. 

The king knows nothing of Reds fathers criminal network, instead the king only knows Reds father as a hero after an incident with a wolf of which Reds father the woodcutter is heralded as a hero. A fearce wolf terrorised the towns for years, and no man survived to even see the beast. Farms and travellers fell prey to the beast for years and years and years. The story goes Reds father single handedly killed the wolf. 

However the truth behind this is less glamorous, as Reds grandmother suffers from lycanthropy. The wolf that terrorised the towns was actually Reds grandmother and her father lied. He didn't beat the wolf in combat but found medication to suppress the grandmothers condition. After the carnage of the wolf stopped after Reds father claimed victory it seemed to the king that Reds father was the hero. 

Red knows this truth of course but she isn't stupid. She has her father round her little finger and her walking expeditions that she meets the party through, she has negociated hard with her father to let her have that freedom. It's a new thing, this being her third trip without her fathers enforcers following her everywhere.

It's very likely she will take over the family business one day, and probably rule with less brutality but still be a force to be recond with like her father.
