**She doesn't fight**

She might smash a big porcelain Jug over someones head, `1d2+1 (-2 Str.) point of subdual damage`

But she knows all the bandits, robbers and low life, they work for her dad

And the Kings Knights think her dad is a hero, and she is well known, and well in favour with them

She's got it all sorted, who's she going to smash a jug over?

She can throw a rock I guess `1d2 (-2 Str.) bludgeoning damage` but as you can see it won't do any damage
