Giant Fox
He's a minor character whos sole purpose is to be Toms first encounter with the devious world. 
Therefore in this vein the giant fox steals Toms innocents, which in a literary sense translates to stealing Toms golden orb
This fox comes from far west where he is normal sized, but has migrated east to find smaller easier things to eat
He's not bigger than Tom but he is huge for a fox 
Giant Fox lies most of the time, or will try to twist the truth through charm
He may refer to Tom as a 'Giant' since Tom is bigger, and that would make Tom think... typical Giant Fox mind game
Is utterly charming untill it has the upper hand then it becomes threatening in a calm, matter of fact and self assured way
For example the giant fox will say "It's time to eat you" in the same way it would say "Pleased to meet you"
The giant fox is hunting smaller humans. It could be dressed up in what would look like hunting atire lol
Tom possibly encounters a snared giant fox who needs Tom to free it
It would share that it is only hunting 'smaller things than itself' if asked "Will you eat us?" 
Tom would not want to free the fox "I'm not sure I want to get involved"
It could trick Tom by getting Tom to pass it his flute "At least pass me my flute, I dropped it and can't reach it since I'm snared. Pass it to me so I can play to myself what harm could it do?"
However the fox would be fluent in magic and charm Tom to free it once it has it's pipe and can begile Tom with a magical song
Sort of like the pied piper
Giant Fox has a twinned nosseled flute which it plays through its two fox nose holes
The the giant fox is free
The giant fox possibly kills or wounds Toms most loved brother Kim
The giant fox steals Toms golden orb and this is important so Tom can have a transformational regret
Giant Fox always runs off laughing
