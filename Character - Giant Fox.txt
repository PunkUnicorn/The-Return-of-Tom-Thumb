Giant Fox
He's a minor character whos sole purpose is to be Toms first encounter with the devious world. 
Therefore in this vein the giant fox steals Toms innocents, which in a literary sense translates to stealing Toms golden orb
This fox comes from far west where he is normal sized, but has migrated east to find smaller easier things to eat
Giant Fox lies all the time
Is utterly charming untill it has the upper hand then it becomes threatening in a calm, matter of fact, self assured way
For example the giant fox will say "It's time to eat you" in the same way it would say "Pleased to meet you"
The giant fox is hunting smaller humans. It could be dressed up in what would look like human fox hunting atire (red coat etc.)
