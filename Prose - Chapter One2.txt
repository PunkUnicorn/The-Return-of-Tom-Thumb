Seeds in her pockets Tom scooped a handful of apple flesh before walking towards the door of the house. Pausing at the door to finish eating, gobbling messy mouthfuls, the door latch caught Toms attention. A mangled wreck that was once working but Tom had never seen it any other way. The latch on the giants door was the first functioning latch she had ever seen. Eating her hands clean she wondered if this latch could be repaired, bent back into shape somehow. Thinking this caused Tom waves of anxiety; her mind remembering what could happen. Stay unnoticed. Stay incognito. Be invisible. Tom closed her mind, stiffened her muscles and pulled the heavy door open.

The overpowering smell of baked apples. The heavy door slammed shut behind her. In the thick air, for a second, Tom was sick of apples. But it passed; chastising herself that it was worse without. Besides, she thought, the pips in her pocket could be interesting. 

At the doorway Tom could see no good seats available at the table with her rowdy mess of brothers sprawled round the edges. They occupied all but one seat: the smallest and least sturdy, the one at the awkward corner of the table. And it was the seat by the drafty wall. Tom wanted to sit so she sat there. 

Often there were brawls over the precious little there was. Seats or more specifically seats and seat positions were a common cause of stand-offs. Tom wasn't bothered. Once or twice she might have had to fight for the right to be left alone. That was worth fighting for but little else was. 

And yet, bellies full even mitigated tensions were rising round the table; competing voices. She didn’t look, no way could she risk eye-contact. It might not escalate to blows. Wiggling her toes, the warm wool lined boots providing her senses with something else to listen to.

Next morning Tom woke early, earlier than anyone else. She left the house and the apple core looked worse in the bright morning sun. The house door opened quietly, Tom looked round. It was the oldest and biggest of the brothers, Kim. Tom relaxed and looked back at the apple. Kim joined her 

“You’re up early?” Kim asked.

“Yes.” Tom replied.

Tom wanted to tell Kim of her plan to head to the village and sell the pips. At the same time she was hoping to keep it a secret. 

“What you doin’?” Kim asked. 

Tom braced her upper body and relaxed her legs shifting weight between her feet ready to flinch.

“I’m going to the village.” Tom replied

Kim did not say anything. Several more possible outcomes sprung to Toms mind. She was ready to dodge. But no, nothing. Tom chanced a gauging side glance towards Kim.

Kim walked a few steps, leaned down and picked up a choice stick. A sturdy branch used the previous day in high spririts by her brothers, it was almost as tall as Tom. Kim held it as a staff vertically, it's base on the floor. Leaning his weight on it, the staff held. Kim turned towards the south trail and looked back at Tom. "You're a stupid sod."

Kim started walking towards the south trail. He walked a few steps turned his head towards Tom slightly: "Are you comming then?"

The south trail was easy in comfortable boots. Kim had fathers hand-me-downs which were only second generation. They looked more or less like normal old boots. Toms boots looked new but obviously too small for anyone other than her and her tiny frame. Early on she had relied on this to stave off others desires on the boots. Tom had lots of time to think

She strongly suspected the boots would fit whoever held them, the same way they had fitted for her. Tom had pulled the boots off the giant very easily, accidentally even, and they slid off the giants feet into her hands as boots of a size for her. 

Their progress along the south trail that morning was smooth and pleasant. The forest thinned and the trail became a road. It was afternoon by the time they saw the dotted buildings far off in the distance. Two rolling hills to cross and they were there. They could be there before dark. They hurried their walking to Toms fastest.

Early afternoon they reached the village. Kim carrying Tom piggy back for the last streach. Kim stopped, Tom jumped down. They had been to the village once before when fleeing the giants house. Tom remembered this looking at the collection of houses and buildings. She could not remember much about it, having too much to think about at the time; giants, surprises about her gender and just unable to process quite what just happened, at the time. Now her head was clear the village was IT WAS LKIE VILLAGE LAND

DRAW MAP OF VILLAGE.



NOW TWO HEROS JOURNEYS AT THE SEAM TIME!!1 THEY CLASH LOL

The Tailor's hero's journey and Toms hero's journey

1) Tom
Call to adventure
-- Tom goes with Kim, meets Jack sells him pips for a cow
-- Kim thinks father would be disapointed with a cow and thrash them, wanting coins. Oh the tragady cause Jacks father is equally disapointed
-- The Tailor meets Tom with Kim and the cow, as Tom and Kim are discussing the situation
-- This could also be good for 'refusal of the call'
-- Also this could be good so The Tailor can see some of Toms beautiful action.
-- Perhaps the thing The Tailor likes is that Kim eggs on Tom to 'go fast' with the boots, but Tom refuses because she things that would get them lost (she doesn't know how the boots work.. they worked once when escaping from the giants but she doesn't know how (The Tailor later tells her that it is actually done by simply wishing it). The Tailor will appreciate the caution.
-- Also The Tailor can see Toms kind spirit because (TL;DR The Tailor gives Tom a coin) when Tom has a coin she gives it to a begger

2) The Tailor, at the same time has his own heros journey
Call to adventure
- He likes people, but is very fussy over those he spends extended periods with like travelling companions. Selfish, foolhardy or thick people can hurt his eyes. Thick people less than the other qualities though. Selfish or foolhardy behaviours will fail he thinks and doesn't want to see how the failure plays out, or be anywhere near it when it does.
- Tom is a surprise to him, Seeing an urchin in near-wrags (that don't even fit her!) but with sharp and dapper boots <<<THIS IS T?HE CALL TO ADVENTURE
- He thinks it curious, and delightfully unexplainable, but continues walking in the direction he already was and walks past them. <<<REFUSAL OF THE CALL
- Kim trying to encourage Tom to make the boots 'go fast' but Tom refusing (Kim wants to get home quickly and the cow is slow). Tom has what is normally hard earnt experience. Impressive.
- The Tailor his back to Tom and Kim having just walked past them slows down walking more slowly, and continues to listen.
- The strange story Tom doesn't really tell about how she got them
- He goes to join them to ask lots of questions.
- The Tailor asking lots of questions about the giants house, Tom thinks of it as dangerous not intriguing.
- He thinks this young lady has learnt this caution the hard way, but with an encounter of note. He wants to know her story. She is reluctant to remember or talk about something so traumatic.
- Toms reluctance to re-live horror and his willingness and capacity to charm Tom aka influence is his trials << TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS IN THREES NORMALLY


NOW THE CLASH LOL
1) hits 2)
Now the Tailor is hooked and wants to know more about Tom, and be her friend. Kim wants to head back home with the cow.

Tom now has an oppotunity to REFUSAL OF THE CALL!!!1
The Tailor is Toms SUPERNATURAL AIDS

Tom can use the word 'adventure' What an adventure! The Tailor might refer to Tom as "Oh! An adventurer!"

Yeah, then the Inn encounter is Toms Crossing the first threshold (the first inn? the one with her and The Tailor?)!!!

3) ?????

4) PROFIT!!!!!!!
