Seeds in her pockets Tom scooped a handful of apple flesh before walking towards the door of the house. Pausing at the door to finish eating, gobbling messy mouthfuls, the door latch caught Toms attention. A mangled wreck that was once working but Tom had never seen it any other way. The latch on the giants door was the first functioning latch she had ever seen. Eating her hands clean she wondered if this latch could be repaired, bent back into shape somehow. Thinking this caused Tom waves of anxiety; her mind remembering what could happen. Stay unnoticed. Stay incognito. Be invisible. Tom closed her mind, stiffened her muscles and pulled the heavy door open.

The overpowering smell of baked apples. The heavy door slammed shut behind her. In the thick air, for a second, Tom was sick of apples. But it passed; chastising herself that it was worse without. Besides, she thought, the pips in her pocket could be interesting. 

At the doorway Tom could see no good seats available at the table with her rowdy mess of brothers sprawled round the edges. They occupied all but one seat: the smallest and least sturdy, the one at the awkward corner of the table. And it was the seat by the drafty wall. Tom wanted to sit so she sat there. 

Often there would be brawls over the precious little there was, seats or more specifically seats and seat positions were a common cause of stand-offs. Tom wasn't bothered. Once or twice she might have had to fight for the right to be left alone. That was worth fighting for but little else was. 

And yet, bellies full even mitigated tensions were rising round the table; competing voices. She didn’t look, no way could she risk eye-contact. It might not escalate to blows. Wiggling her toes, the warm wool lined boots providing her senses with something else to listen to.

Next morning Tom woke early, earlier than anyone else. She left the house and the apple core looked worse in the bright morning sun. The house door opened quietly, Tom looked round. It was the oldest and biggest of the brothers, Kim. Tom relaxed and looked back at the apple. Kim joined her “You’re up early?” Kim asked.

“Yes.” Tom replied.

Tom wanted to tell Kim of her plan to head to the village and sell the pips. At the same time she was hoping to keep it a secret. 

“What you doin’?” Kim asked. 

Tom braced her upper body and relaxed her legs shifting weight between her feet ready to flinch.

“I’m going to the village.” Tom replied

Kim didn’t say anything. Several possible outcomes sprung to Toms mind some of which required dodging.



Call to adventure
-- Tom goes with Kim, meets Jack sells him pips for a cow
-- Kim thinks father would be disapointed with a cow and thrash them, wanting coins. Oh the tragady cause Jacks father is equally disapointed
-- The Tailor meets Tom with Kim and the cow, as Tom and Kim are discussing the situation
-- This could also be good for 'refusal of the call'
-- Also this could be good so The Tailor can see some of Toms beautiful action.
-- Perhaps the thing The Tailor likes is that Kim eggs on Tom to 'go fast' with the boots, but Tom refuses because she things that would get them lost (she doesn't know how the boots work.. they worked once when escaping from the giants but she doesn't know how (The Tailor later tells her that it is actually done by simply wishing it). The Tailor will appreciate the caution.
-- Also The Tailor can see Toms kind spirit because (TL;DR The Tailor gives Tom a coin) when Tom has a coin she gives it to a begger
Refusal of the call
Supernatural aid
Crossing the first threshold (the first inn? the one with her and The Tailor?)
