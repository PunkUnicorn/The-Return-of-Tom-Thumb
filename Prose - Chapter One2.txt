Seads in her pockets she scooped a handfull of apple flesh before walking towards the door of the house, happily scoffing messy mouthfulls. While she was chewing she paused before the door looking at the mangled wreck that was once a latch. Tom had never seen it any other way, the latch on the giants door being the first functioning latch she had ever seen. Scoffing up the rest of the goop she wondered if their latch could be bent back into shape. Thinking this caused cascading waves of anxiety. The trouble that would cause. Stay incognito. Tom closed her mind, stiffened her muscles and pulled the heavy door open.

The overpowering smell of baked apples. The heavy door slammed shut behind her. In the thick air, for a second, Tom was sick of apples. But it passed, chastising herself that it was worse without. Besides the pips in her pocket could be, she thought, interesting. At the doorway Tom could see no good seats available at the table with her rowdy mess of brothers sprawlled round the edges. They occupied all but one seat: the smallest and least sturdy, the one at the corner of the table, the seat by the drafty wall. Tom wanted to sit so she sat there.

Pips in pocket ready for main adventure


Call to Adventure
- Does The Tailor knock? The Tailor is asking for directions? 
-- This is a good one cause easy 'refusal of the call'
- Tom suggests planting pips, gets laughed at
-- Father sais go sell them and get some coins and bring him the money
-- Tom goes with Kim, meets Jack sells him pips for a cow
-- Kim thinks father would be disapointed with a cow and thrash them, wanting coins. Oh the tragady cause Jacks father is equally disapointed
-- The Tailor meets Tom with Kim and the cow, as Tom and Kim are discussing the situation
-- This could also be good for 'refusal of the call'
-- Also this could be good so The Tailor can see some of Toms beautiful action.
-- Perhaps the thing The Tailor likes is that Kim eggs on Tom to 'go fast' with the boots, but Tom refuses because she things that would get them lost (she doesn't know how the boots work.. they worked once when escaping from the giants but she doesn't know how (The Tailor later tells her that it is actually done by simply wishing it). The Tailor will appreciate the caution.
-- Also The Tailor can see Toms kind spirit because (TL;DR The Tailor gives Tom a coin) when Tom has a coin she gives it to a begger
