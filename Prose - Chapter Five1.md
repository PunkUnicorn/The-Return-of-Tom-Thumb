# Chapter Five

Walking along a rough path, a field on one side, a short stone wall the other, The Prince could barely keep his eyes open. He had been walking for a short time. 

The wall stopped at a grove. On one side the field continued, the other: a thick meadow seemed to go on forever. A fallen tree invited him to sit down, promising a comfortable seat. He had not seen anyone else since leaving the old man's hut, and he was too fatigued to care about being recognised. He took his helmet off, resting it against one of the fallen tree's branches.

Working his pack off his back, he sat on the fallen tree and almost instantly fell asleep.

When The Prince awoke the wind had picked up. The branches whistled, clouds had gathered. It looked like a storm was coming. The Prince found this exciting; a chance to use his equipment. But more than that; he felt his life on the road had started.

Working his gauntlets off he pried the buckles open on his pack. The canvas skin of the backpack soaked through, the straps were difficult to work free. 

With the backpack unbuckled he pulled out a tarred canvas sheet; it would make his tent. Unwieldy in the wind, the large sheet flapped wildly. The Prince pegged down one corner, driving the wooden peg with a stomp. Taking the other corner of the tent sheet he fastened it to the edge of his makeshift 'seat'. A bivouac against the side of the fallen tree would suffice. With some more driven pegs, The Prince thought he had engineered enough of a shelter to withstand what was coming.

With him and his pack inside the makeshift shelter, shielded from the wind outside, he nestled down and listened to his internal chatter: it fed him concerns. But these were dismissed; he was in isolation. The elements outside were being unsuccessful with their barrage. The wind mauled the tent, whipping sporadic escalations of aggression. But the pegs, the rope and the canvas won decisively. With each victory The Prince fell deeper and deeper into sleep.

Birdsong woke him. He peered out of the tent; it was afternoon, the sky had cleared. He felt more awake, and with the winter sunshine on his face, he felt good. He could see there was no storm earlier. The relief of easier travelling hampered by a slight disappointment; it was not a true test.

The tarred sheet did not pack well. Methodically rolling it tight, he saw a figure in the distance. He could not see much about them, except for their striking red robe. It was a good sign seeing someone travelling from the direction he was going; the trail did, at least, go somewhere.

He had finished rolling the sheet when the red figure was close enough to see, but too far away to speak to. It was a young woman, she lowered her red hood and waved cheerfully, then continued walking towards him. He interrupted his two handed packing to respond with a quick knight's salute.

Once the taught canvas bundle was crammed back into his backpack, and the straps pulled tight, he squatted to shoulder the straps, hopping it's weight on the fallen tree before bearing the full weight.

"Hello." the young woman said.

"Greetings." 

"Are you setting up camp here?" she asked.

"No, actually I've just packed everything up."

She seemed disappointed. "Are you travelling north?" she asked hopefully.

"Yes.", he was pleased to accommodate, but he had noticed she had been travelling in the opposite direction.

"Would you join me? We could travel together." she quickly offered.
  
"I'm not sure if you're aware, you were travelling southwards. I'm going the way you came."; he felt he had to say that.

"I've been lost for a while. I wanted to avoid the main roads, but it's hard to keep track of direction, ... I'm not on trails I'm familiar with."

The Prince nodded in understanding, although he himself knew several ways to identify north. Not everyone had such training. "To accompany you would be a duty and honour." he responded with stiff, earnest resolve.

She looked The Prince (or rather The Knight) up and down while balancing her weight on one leg, the other crossed behind it on point. Her hands behind her back. "That's what I thought." she concluded with satisfied approval. "Are you a knight errant?"

"Yes.", his disguise working, "I am. I'm a knight errant."

She seemed impressed. "I'm running an errond myself, I need to get far north. But I get to take my own time, and do it in my own way. I'm actually making my own errands now, and I need to stay off the main trail for a while."

The Knight nodded at this, as if it made sense, exhilarated to have travelling company; cover for his escape.

"I'm Red," she beamed a warm, welcoming smile, "I'm thrilled you're joining me."

But not as pleased as The Knight, it was all going rather well. Their common goal: a need to travel far north and stay off the main trail. 

As they walked north, along the way Red had come from, The Knight provided conversation: replaying his rehearsed lies, what he could say about his errond, what he could not. Red offered no doubt, she was delighted with all parts of his script.

Once he had finished his short, well rehearsed excuse, a comfortable silence settled. Red pointed ahead; "There's a beautiful spot on the edge of the meddow, a small stream next to a clearing. It's next to a bramble thicket, so I'm surprised I found it. It's easy to miss.". To The Knight this sounded ideal.

Breakfast was as delicious as the stew the previous evening. "Do you eat like this all the time?" she asked The Tailor.

"I try not to.", he apologised, "The food gets progressively better the more south you go.". He pushed his tin plate forward on the table and leaned back; cocking the chair on two legs, so he could lean against the wall, instead of the chair's back.

He looked at Tom. "You asked me where I was going?", suppressing a grin, looking relaxed against the wall. "I'm a travelling tailor, I just travel.", but then he thought for a short time and added, cheerfully, but resiliently: "And I do tailoring."

Tom was queuing up questions with each of The Tailors statements. Travelling southwards sounded good, tailoring was anybody's guess.

"What's tailoring?"; she felt she could ask him.

"I thought you would never ask." slyly asserted The Tailor, mirthfully. "I've settled up with the inn keeper, let's show you tailoring." and he got up, shouted a few words of farewell to people they could not see (getting a shouted farewell back), and walked out the main door of the inn, beckoning Tom with his head, twitching his neck. "Come on.", his stride jaunty. He was enjoying this.

Outside, Tom stood ridiculously. Her arms out straight, her legs apart. The Tailor worked under her arm, with pins in his mouth. "And I'll do something with your hair." he tried to say.

"What are you doing?" Tom's slight tone of desperation gave The Tailor a clue she wanted more explanation than the word: 'tailoring'. He took the pins out of his mouth.

"I'm bringing in your jumper so it fits better round the shoulders and waist.". After more pause, and a thinking face, he added: "I say fits better, but what I mean is: better than not fitting whatsoever."

She did not like standing like this, but she trusted what The Tailor was doing; it must be important for travelling. He worked both underarms, and similarly on her trousers. 

Drawing her away from a small pile of fabric, he sat her down, explaining: 'Now to sort your hair out!'. She managed to look at what he had done to her jumper. It was less baggy, with a long thick stitch. It was well balanced against the other under-arm alteration. The excess length of trouser leg had been cut off and seamed, instead of roll-ups.

"There...", he concluded, and brought a small mirror to her face. Her hair had more defined steps, but was still shaggy. "Just a tidy.", and then he paused again, and for a moment almost looked like he was going to say something, but it passed.

"That's good.", she muttered, describing the mobility and lighter feeling round the arms. She kicked each leg, inspecting each foot on their landing. She noticed her trouser legs now covered her boots, more so than when they were rolled up. She liked how he was helping to hide them, she had not even talked about that. 

The Tailor saw her nod with the minimum of approval, but her eyes showed she was very pleased. "We can easily make the next town before lunch.", he gave Tom's hair two swift brushes with his fingertips on one side, "It's got the third worst inn in the world.", he explained sardonically, "Lets go."

And they set off walking side by side on the south trail.
