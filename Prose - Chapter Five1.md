# Chapter Five

Walking along a rough path, a field on one side, a short stone wall the other, The Prince could barely keep his eyes open. He had been walking for a short time. 

The wall stopped at a grove. On one side the field continued, the other: a thick meadow seemed to go on forever. A fallen tree invited him to sit down, promising a comfortable seat. He had not seen anyone else since leaving the old man's hut, and he was too fatigued to care about being recognised. He took his helmet off, resting it against one of the fallen tree's branches.

Working his pack off his back, he sat on the fallen tree and almost instantly fell asleep.

When The Prince awoke the wind had picked up. The branches whistled, clouds had gathered. It looked like a storm was coming. The Prince found this exciting; a chance to use his equipment. But more than that; he felt his life on the road had started.

Working his gauntlets off he pried the buckles open on his pack. The canvas skin of the backpack soaked through, the straps were difficult to work free. 

With the backpack unbuckled he pulled out a tarred canvas sheet; it would make his tent. Unwieldy in the wind, the large sheet flapped wildly. The Prince pegged down one corner, driving the wooden peg with a stomp. Taking the other corner of the tent sheet he fastened it to the edge of his makeshift 'seat'. A bivouac against the side of the fallen tree would suffice. With some more driven pegs, The Prince thought he had engineered enough of a shelter to withstand what was coming.

With him and his pack inside the makeshift shelter, shielded from the wind outside, he nestled down and listened to his internal chatter: it fed him concerns. But these were dismissed; he was in isolation. The elements outside were being unsuccessful with their barrage. The wind mauled the tent, whipping sporadic escalations of aggression. But the pegs, the rope and the canvas won decisively. With each victory The Prince fell deeper and deeper into sleep.

Birdsong woke him. He peered out of the tent; it was afternoon, the sky had cleared. He felt more awake, and with the winter sunshine on his face, he felt good. He could see there was no storm earlier. The relief of easier travelling hampered by a slight disappointment; it was not a true test.

The tarred sheet did not pack well. Methodically rolling it tight, he saw a figure in the distance. He could not see much about them, except for their striking red robe. It was a good sign seeing someone travelling from the direction he was going; the trail did, at least, go somewhere.

He had finished rolling the sheet when the red figure was close enough to see, but too far away to speak to. It was a young woman, she lowered her red hood and waved cheerfully, then continued walking towards him. He interrupted his two handed packing to respond with a quick knight's salute.

Once the taught canvas bundle was crammed back into his backpack, and the straps pulled tight, he squatted to shoulder the straps, taking a breath before bearing the full weight.

"Hello." the young woman said.

"Greetings.", he replied as cheerfully, putting his helmet on, but leaving the visor open.

"Are you setting up camp here?" she asked.

"No, actually I've just packed everything up."

She seemed disappointed. "Are you travelling north?" she asked hopefully.

"Yes.", he was pleased to accommodate, but she had been travelling in the opposite direction.

"Would you join me? We could travel together." she quickly offered.
  
"I'm not sure if you're aware, you were travelling southwards. I'm going the way you came."; he felt he had to say that.

"I've been lost for a while. I wanted to avoid the main roads, but it's hard to keep track of direction, ...I'm not on trails I'm familiar with."

The Prince nodded in understanding, although he himself knew several ways to identify north. Not everyone had such training. "To accompany you would be a duty and an honour." he responded earnestly.

She looked The Knight up and down, while balancing her weight on one leg, the other crossed behind it on point. She held her hands behind her back. "That's what I thought.", she concluded with satisfied approval. "Are you a knight errant?"

"Yes.", his disguise working, "I am, yes. I'm a knight errant."

She seemed impressed. "I'm running an errand myself, I need to get far north, and I can't use the main routes. I sort of make my own 
errands now."

The Knight nodded at this, as if it made sense, exhilarated to have travelling company; cover for his escape.

"I'm Red," she beamed a warm, welcoming smile, "I'm thrilled you're joining me."

But not as pleased as The Knight, it was all going rather well. Their common goal: a need to travel far north and stay off the main trail. 

As they walked together, along the way Red had come from, The Knight provided conversation: replaying his rehearsed lines, what he could say about his errond, what he could not. Red offered no doubt, she was delighted with all parts of his script.

Once he had finished his short, well rehearsed excuse, a comfortable silence settled. Red pointed ahead; "There's a beautiful spot on the edge of the meadow, a small stream next to a clearing. It's hidden by a bramble thicket. I'm surprised I found it."

To The Knight this sounded ideal.

Breakfast was as delicious as the stew the previous evening. "Do you eat like this all the time?" she asked The Tailor.

"I try not to.", he replied. He pushed his tin plate forward on the table and leaned back; cocking the chair on two legs, so he could lean against the wall, instead of the chair's back.

He looked at Tom. "You asked me where I was going?", looking relaxed against the wall. "I'm a travelling tailor, I just travel.", but then he stopped and thought, then added: "And I do tailoring."; using a hand gesture to make a point of this.

"What's tailoring?"; she felt she could ask him.

He leaned forward, replying mirthfully: "I thought you would never ask. Let's go and show you tailoring.", and then he got up and walked out the inn's door, beckoning Tom with his head. "Come on.". He hurried out with a jaunty stride. He was enjoying this.

Outside, Tom stood ridiculously. Her arms out straight and her legs apart. The Tailor worked under her arm, with pins in his mouth. "And I'll do something with your hair." he tried to say.

"What are you doing?" Tom's slight tone of desperation gave The Tailor a clue she wanted more explanation than the word: 'tailoring'. He took the pins out of his mouth.

"I'm bringing in your jumper so it fits better round the shoulders and waist.". After more pause, and a thinking face, he added: "I say fits better, but what I mean is: better than not fitting whatsoever."

She felt exposed standing like this, but she trusted what The Tailor was doing; it must be important for travelling. He worked around each underarm, and similarly on her trousers. 

Drawing her away from a small pile of fabric, he sat her down, explaining: "Now to sort your hair out!". She managed to look at what he had done to her jumper. It was less baggy, with a long thick stitch. It was well balanced against the other under-arm alteration. The excess length of trouser leg had been cut off and seamed, instead of roll-ups. 

However, between looks, her head possition was adjusted by a gentle hand. Sometimes, but not always, the touch was followed by the sound of snipping.

"There...", and he brought a small mirror to her face. Her hair had defined steps, but was still shaggy. "Just a tidy.", he underplayed, and then he paused. For a moment, he almost looked like he was going to say something, but it passed.

"That's good.", she said, instantly regretting the vocal impulse, moving her arms around. She was surprised at the lighter feeling. Kicking her legs she inspected each landing. Now her trousers covered her boots more. That was convenient.

The Tailor was looking at her expectantly. She nodded with the minimum of approval, but the girl's eyes said more. "The next town's not far, we'll make it before lunch.". He turned southwards: "It's got the third worst inn in the world. You have to see it to believe it. Lets go."

They started walking, Tom suddenly had no idea what to expect.

Red and The Knight sat by the stream. The fire was building strength; wet blankets, from The Knights pack, propped up with sticks to capture the warmth. The half empty pack itself, planted just beyond the fire's range, sat as a centerpiece to the evenly strewn contents; a tiny city of equipment. Two small tents, in parallel, looked ready; their entrance sheets open in identical fashion. 

The midday sun felt good, and with the fire's warmth The Knight started to feel like could be warm again. Red had her hood pulled over her head and she hummed a gentle melody. Listening, he heard contentment. It elevated the sunshine on his face and the warmth on his back. The stream was great to look at.
