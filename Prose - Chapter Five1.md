# Chapter Five

Walking along a rough path, a field on one side, a short stone wall the other, The Prince could barely keep his eyes open. He had been walking for a short time. 

The wall stopped at a grove. On one side the field continued, the other: a thick medow seemed to go on forever. A fallen tree invited him to sit down, promising a comfortable seat. He had not seen anyone else since leaving the old man's hut, and too fatigued to care about being recognised.

He worked his pack off his back, sat on the fallen tree and almost instantly fell asleep.

When he awoke the wind had picked up. The branches whistled, clouds had gathered. It looked like a storm was coming. The Prince found this exciting; a chance to use his equipment. But more than that; a chance to start his life on the road.

Working his gauntlets off he pried the buckles open on his pack. The canvas skin of the backpack soaked through, the straps were difficult to work free. 

With the backpack unbuckled he pulled out a tared canvas sheet; it would make his tent. Unwieldy in the wind, the large sheet flapped wildly. The Prince pegged down one corner, driving the wooden peg with a stomp. Taking the other corner of the tent sheet he fastened it to the edge of his makeshift 'seat'. A bivouac against the side of the fallen tree would suffice. With some more driven pegs The Prince thought he had engineered enough of a shelter to withstanding what was coming.

With him and his pack in the makeshift shelter, shielded from the wind outside, he nesled down and listened to his internal chatter: it fed him concerns. But these were dismissed; he was in isolation. The elements outside were being unsuccessful with their barage. The wind mauled the tent, whipping sporadic esculations of aggression. But the pegs, the rope and the canvas won decisively. The Prince fell back to sleep.

Birdsong woke him. He peered out of the tent; it was afternoon, the sky had cleared. He felt more awake, and with the winter sunshine on his face, he felt good. There was no storm earlier. The relief of easier travelling hampered by a slight disapointment; it was not a true test without a storm. Perhaps later.

The tared sheet did not pack well. Methodically rolling it tight, he saw a figure in the distance. He could not see much about them, except for their striking red robe. It was a good sign seeing someone travelling from the direction he was travelling; the trail did, at least, go somewhere.

He had finished rolling the sheet when the red figure was close enough to see, but too far away to speak to. It was a young woman, she lowered her red hood and waved cheerfully, then continued walking towards him. He interuppted his two handed packing to return with a quick knight's salute.

Once the taught canvas bundle was crammed back into his backpack, and the straps pulled tight, he squatted to shoulder the straps, hopping it's weight on the fallen tree before bearing the full weight.

"Hello." the young woman said.

"Greetings." 

"Are you setting up camp here?" she asked.

"No, I've just packed my shelter away."

She seemed disapointed. "Are you travelling north?" she asked a little hopeful. 

"Yes.", he was pleased to accomodate, but she was travelling the other way.

"Perhaps we could travel together?" she quickly suggested.
 
  
"You're travelling southwards, I'm going the way you came."; he felt he had to say that.

"I wanted to avoid the main road, it's hard to keep track of direction off the routes I'm familiar with." 

The Prince nodded in understanding, although he himself knew several ways to identify north. Not everyone had such training. "To accompany you would be an honour and a priveledge." he responded with stiff, earnst resolve.

"That's what I thoght." she concluded with definative, satisfied approval. "Are you an errond knight?"

"Yes.", his disguise working, "I'm an errond knight."

"I'm running an errond myself," she offered, "but I get to take my own time, and do it in my own way. I'm makng my own erronds."

The Prince, or rather The Knight, nodded at this as if it made sense, happy to have travelling company, as cover for his escape.

"I'm Red," she beemed a warm, welcoming smile, "it's great you're joining me, I'm really pleased."

But not as pleased as The Knight, it was all going rather well. Their common goal: a need to travel far north and stay off the main trail. 

As they walked north, the way Red had come from. The Knght replayed his rehearsed lies about his errond, what he could say about it, what he could not. Red offered no doubt, she was delighted with all parts of his script. 

Once he finished his short, and well rehearsed excuse, a comfortable silence settled. "There's a beutiful spot on the edge of the meddow ahead," Red shared, breaking the silence, "A small stream next to a clearing next to a thicket."

The Knight knew this would be their camp location, and it sounded ideal.
