# Chapter Five

Walking along a rough path, a field on one side, a short stone wall the other, The Prince could barely keep his eyes open. He had not been walking for very long but his sense of time was warped with fatigue. 

The wall stopped at a grove. On one side the field continued and the other was a thick medow. A fallen tree invited him to sit down, promising a comfortable seat. It was still morning, and this isolated spot inbetween a field and a medow was probably a safe spot. 

He worked his pack off his back, lowering it gently onto the ground. Once the weight was on the ground, and he was sat on the fallen tree he lost all thought of safety and sank into a deep sleep.

When he woke the wind had picked up and the branches whistled. Clouds had gathered; it looked like a storm. This was exciting, a chance to use his equipment. Working his gauntlets off, he pried the bukles open on his pack. The canvas skin soaked through, the straps difficult to work free. 

The canvas sheets of his tent, unwieldy in the wind, pegged down with a stomp; one corner subdued. A bivouac against the side of the fallen three would suffice till he recovered.
