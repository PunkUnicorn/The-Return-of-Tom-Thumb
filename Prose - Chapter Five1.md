# Chapter Five

Walking along a rough path, a field on one side, a short stone wall the other, The Prince could barely keep his eyes open. He had not been walking for very long but his sense of time was warped with fatigue. 

The wall stopped at a grove. On one side the field continued, the other a thick medow started and seemed to go on forever. A fallen tree invited him to sit down, promising a comfortable seat. He had not seen anyone since leaving the old man's hut, nobody would bother him here in this isolated spot. 

He worked his pack off his back, lowering it gently onto the ground. Once the weight left him he sat on the fallen tree and almost instantly fell asleep.

When he woke the wind had picked up, the branches whistled. Clouds had gathered, it looked like a storm. The Prince found this exciting, a chance to use his equipment. Working his gauntlets off he pried the bukles open on his pack. The canvas skin of the backpack soaked through, the straps were difficult to work free. 

With the backpack unbuckled he then pulled out tared canvas sheets which would make his tent. Unwieldy in the wind, the large sheet flapped wildly. The Prince pegged down one corner, driving a wooden stake in the ground with a stomp, then fastened the other corner to his makeshift seat. A bivouac against the side of the fallen three would suffice till he caught up on some rest.
