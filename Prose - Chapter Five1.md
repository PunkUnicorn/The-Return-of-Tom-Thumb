# Chapter Five

Walking along a rough path, a field on one side, a short stone wall the other, The Prince could barely keep his eyes open. He had been walking for a short time. 

The wall stopped at a grove. On one side the field continued, the other: a thick meadow seemed to go on forever. A fallen tree invited him to sit down, promising a comfortable seat. He had not seen anyone else since leaving the old man's hut, and he was too fatigued to care about being recognised. He took his helmet off, resting it against one of the fallen tree's branches.

Working his pack off his back, he sat on the fallen tree and almost instantly fell asleep.

When The Prince awoke the wind had picked up. The branches whistled, clouds had gathered. It looked like a storm was coming. The Prince found this exciting; a chance to use his equipment. But more than that; he felt his life on the road was begining.

Working his gauntlets off, he pried the buckles open on his pack. The canvas skin of the backpack soaked through, the straps were difficult to work free. 

With the backpack unbuckled he pulled out a tarred canvas sheet; it would make his tent. Unwieldy in the wind, the large sheet flapped wildly. The Prince pegged down one corner, driving the wooden peg with a stomp. Taking the other corner of the tent sheet he fastened it to the edge of his makeshift 'seat'. A bivouac against the side of the fallen tree would suffice. With some more driven pegs, The Prince thought he had engineered enough of a shelter to withstand what was coming.

With him and his pack inside the makeshift shelter, shielded from the wind outside, he nestled down and listened to his internal chatter: it fed him concerns. But these were dismissed; he was in isolation. The elements outside were being unsuccessful with their barrage. The wind mauled the tent, whipping sporadic escalations of aggression. But the pegs, the rope and the canvas won decisively. With each victory The Prince fell deeper and deeper into sleep.

Birdsong woke him. He peered out of the tent; it was afternoon, the sky had cleared. He felt more awake, and with the winter sunshine on his face, he felt good. He could see there was no storm earlier. The relief of easier travelling hampered by a slight disappointment; it was not a true test.

The tarred sheet did not pack well. Methodically rolling it tight, he saw a figure in the distance. He could not see much about them, except for their striking red robe. It was a good sign seeing someone travelling from the direction he was going; the trail did, at least, go somewhere.

He had finished rolling the sheet when the red figure was close enough to see, but too far away to speak to. It was a young woman, she lowered her red hood and waved cheerfully, then continued walking towards him. He interrupted his two handed packing to respond with a quick knight's salute.

Once the taught canvas bundle was crammed back into his backpack, and the straps pulled tight, he squatted to shoulder the straps, taking a breath before bearing the full weight.

"Hello." the young woman said.

"Greetings.", he replied just as cheerfully, putting his helmet on but leaving the visor open.

"Are you making a camp?" she asked.

"No, actually I've just packed everything up."

She seemed disappointed. "Are you travelling north?" she asked hopefully.

"Yes.", he was pleased to accommodate, but she had been travelling in the opposite direction.

But quickly she asked: "Would you join me? We could travel together."
  
"I'm not sure if you're aware, you were travelling southwards. I'm going the way you came."; he felt he had to say that.

"I've been lost for a while. I wanted to avoid the main roads, but it's hard to keep track of direction, ...I'm not on trails I'm familiar with."

The Prince nodded in understanding, although he himself knew several ways to identify north. Not everyone had such training. "To accompany you would be a duty and an honour." he responded earnestly.

She looked The Knight up and down, while balancing her weight on one leg, the other crossed behind it on point. She held her hands behind her back. "That's what I thought.", she concluded with satisfied approval. "Are you a knight errant?"

"Yes.", his disguise working, "I am. I am a knight errant."

She seemed impressed. "I'm running an errand myself, I need to get far north, and I can't use the main routes. I sort of make my own 
errands now."

The Knight nodded at this, as if it made sense, exhilarated to have travelling company; more cover for his escape.

"I'm Red," she beamed a warm, welcoming smile, "I'm thrilled you're joining me."

But not as pleased as The Knight, it was all going rather well. Their common goal: a need to travel far north and stay off the main trail. 

As they walked together, along the way Red had come from, The Knight provided conversation: replaying his rehearsed lines, what he could say about his errond, what he could not. Red offered no doubt, she was delighted with all parts of his script.

Once he had finished his short, well rehearsed excuse, a comfortable silence settled. Red pointed ahead; "There's a beautiful spot on the edge of the meadow, a small stream next to a clearing. It's hidden by a bramble thicket. I'm surprised I found it."

To The Knight this sounded ideal.

Breakfast was as delicious, if not more so, than the stew the previous evening: eggs, bacon, dark bread and butter. She sneaked what she could into her pocket; a saussage. There was no way to pocket her mashed potatoe, so she finished the lot. Potatoe had never tasted so good. "Do you eat like this all the time?".

"I try not to.", he replied, pushing his empty, tin plate forward. He cocked his chair on two legs to lean against the wall, instead of the chair's back.

"You asked me where I was going?", relaxed against the wall. "I'm a travelling tailor, I just travel."

Then, as if he had remembered something, he added, using his finger to accentuate: "And I do tailoring."

"What's tailoring?"; she felt she could ask him.

Leaning forward, he replied mirthfully: "I thought you would never ask. Let's go and show you tailoring."

And he got up and walked towards the inn's door, beckoning Tom with his head; "Come on.", a jaunty walk. He was enjoying this.

Outside, Tom stood ridiculously. Her arms were out straight and her legs apart. The Tailor worked under her arm, with pins in his mouth. "And I'll do something with your hair." he tried to say.

"What are you doing?", the tone of desperation giving The Tailor a clue that she wanted more explanation than the word: 'tailoring'. He took the pins out of his mouth.

"I'm bringing your jumper in so it fits better round the shoulders, and waist.". After more pause, and a thinking face, he added: "I say fits better, but what I mean is: better than not fitting whatsoever."

She felt exposed standing like this, but she trusted what The Tailor was doing; it must be important for travelling. He sewed around each underarm, and similarly on her trousers. 

Drawing her away from a small pile of fabric, he sat her down, explaining: "Now to sort your hair out!". She managed to look at what he had done to her jumper. It was less baggy, with a long thick stitch. It was well balanced against the other under-arm alteration. The excess length of trouser leg had been cut off and seamed, instead of roll-ups. 

However, between looks, her head possition was adjusted by a gentle hand. Sometimes, but not always, the touch was followed by the sound of snipping.

"There...", and he brought a small mirror to her face. Her hair had defined steps, but was still shaggy. "Just a tidy.", he underplayed, and then he paused. For a moment, he almost looked like he was going to say something, but it passed.

"That's good.", she said, instantly regretting the vocal impulse, moving her arms around. She was surprised at the lighter feeling. Kicking her legs she inspected each landing. Now her trousers covered her boots more. That was convenient.

The Tailor looked at her expectantly. She nodded with the minimum of approval, but the girl's eyes said more. "The next town's not far, we'll make it before lunch.". He turned southwards: "It's got the third worst inn in the world. You have to see it to believe it. Lets go."

They started walking. Suddenly, Tom had no idea what to expect.

Red and The Knight sat by the stream. The fire was building strength; wet blankets, from The Knights pack, propped up with sticks to capture the warmth. The half empty pack itself, planted just beyond the fire's range, sat as a center-piece to the evenly strewn contents; a tiny city of equipment. Two small tents, in parallel, looked ready; their entrance sheets open in identical fashion. 

The midday sun felt good, and with the fire's warmth, The Knight started to feel like he could be warm again. Red had pulled her hood over her head and was humming a gentle melody. Listening, he heard contentment. It elevated the mood. The stream was interesting viewing. Too shallow for fishing, he will be cooking his standard issue rations tonight.

Red finished humming, the crackle of the fire taking main stage; popping a spark, it gently collapsed on itself. The Knight pushed himself off the ground and added three logs. A quick appraisal and he turned back to the stream, resuming his place next to Red.

There was no talking. The Knight took mental inventory, thinking through his groups of equipment: cooking, cleaning, engineering, repairing, fighting. Having set up camp, he was prevalently aware that his items were now his home, and his life. 

Red hunched over a small, open papyrus codex. The feather end of her raven quill exaggerating the slow, careful swirling of the writing. The Knight noticed a tiny, elegant ink bottle tied to a cord around her neck. He himself had some ink, sealing wax and parchment, but it was for official knight's business only. Like his, her feather was a pinion; an optimum feather for a quill, he was somewhat impressed. 

As the afternoon drew in, the blankets dried and the fire became a stove. They dined on a knight's banquet of dried meats, pickled vegetables and fruit preserves. Dispite his earlier rest he began to feel fatigue catch up with him. "I'll take an early rest. I'll be awake again in the early hours to take over the watch.". Red understood and was fine with this arrangement. She placed two more small logs on the fire and slouched back, watching the fresh logs adapt to their new home.

"Here it is.", The Tailor pointed towards the approaching town. Tom wanted to sit down, but The Tailor was speeding up: "I need to see the smithy while we're here,", Tom offered a blind nod of agreement, "and we're going to need a few things."

The two of them hurried past somebody slumped, on the floor, against the wall of a building. "He's drunk.": explained The Tailor, "We'll see the smith first.", adding behind a hand as if telling a taboo: "he's the nicest person here."

But there was nobody else to be seen as Tom followed The Tailor. Rats darted away through a crooked, almost accidental ally. Competing buildings spared the minimum of walkways, and these were occupied by piles of rubbish. The size of the rats that darted away, Tom knew people here did not go hungry.

The Tailor led her out of the maze into a long clearing in front of a high wooden wall. The Tailor seemed to know where he was going, through a broken door in the wall. The other side...
