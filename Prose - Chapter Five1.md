# Chapter Five

Walking along a rough path, a field on one side, a short stone wall the other, The Prince could barely keep his eyes open. He had been walking for a short time. 

The wall stopped at a grove. On one side the field continued, the other: a thick medow seemed to go on forever. A fallen tree invited him to sit down, promising a comfortable seat. He had not seen anyone else since leaving the old man's hut, and too fatigued to care about being recognised.

He worked his pack off his back, sat on the fallen tree and almost instantly fell asleep.

When he awoke the wind had picked up. The branches whistled, clouds had gathered. It looked like a storm was coming. The Prince found this exciting; a chance to use his equipment. But more than that; a chance to start his life on the road.

But these were dismissed; he was in isolation. The elements outside were being unsuccessful with their barage. The wind mauled the tent, whipping sporadic esculations of aggression. But the pegs, the rope and the canvas won decisively. The Prince fell back to sleep.

Birdsong woke him, he peered out the tent. Afternoon, and the sky had cleared. He felt more awake, and the winter sunshine without a soul around, he had it all to himself. He could see was no storm; the relief of easier travelling hampered by a slight disapointment: it was not a true test.

It would take him a while to repack that tarred sheet, it did not pack well. But he would


[As he is packing he sees someone in the distance, travelling on the path towards him from the direction he is going... south. The person wears a very distinctive red hood]
