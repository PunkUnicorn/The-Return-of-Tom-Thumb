# Chapter Five

Walking along a rough path, a field on one side, a short stone wall the other, The Prince could barely keep his eyes open. He had been walking for a short time. 

The wall stopped at a grove. On one side the field continued, the other: a thick medow seemed to go on forever. A fallen tree invited him to sit down, promising a comfortable seat. He had not seen anyone else since leaving the old man's hut, and too fatigued to care about being recognised.

He worked his pack off his back, sat on the fallen tree and almost instantly fell asleep.

When he awoke, the wind had picked up. The branches whistled, clouds had gathered. It looked like a storm was coming. The Prince found this exciting; a chance to use his equipment. But more than that; a chance to start his life on the road.

Working his gauntlets off he pried the buckles open on his pack. The canvas skin of the backpack soaked through, the straps were difficult to work free. 

With the backpack unbuckled he pulled out his tared canvas sheets; they would make his tent. Unwieldy in the wind, the large sheet flapped wildly. The Prince pegged down one corner, driving the wooden peg with a stomp, then fastened the other corner to his makeshift seat. A bivouac against the side of the fallen tree would suffice. Some more fastening pegs, the taught rope loops easily withstanding what's coming.

With him and his pack in the makeshift canvas shelter, shielded from the wind and the oncoming storm, he nesled down. The elements outside were being unsuccessful in their barage. The Prince drifted off to sleep listening to the wind mauling the tent, sporadic esculations of aggression, but the pegs, rope and canvas won decisively. Falling back to sleep was easy.
