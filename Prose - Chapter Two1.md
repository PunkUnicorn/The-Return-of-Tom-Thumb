# Chapter Two

Kim got his breath back and moved a few steps to join his sister. Tom acknowledged Kim with a glance, her train of thought gone. 

[Vibrantise:]
They walked towards the village at a slow pace to take it all in: sights, sounds and smells, geese, dogs and people. Carts and horses. Stacks of things by the buildings. Sacks of things by the stacks. Smoke, banging. A sudden shout, but it was not for them.

And how people were dressed. Everyone had good boots or cloggs. Tom gave her own boots a quick look. Pride enveloped her with a dawning thought: she was fitting in.

Tom looked to Kim: he looked perturbed as if the whole thing was a bad idea. Tom turned to face her brother with the excitement she felt; an invitation. Kim returned her look but it was clear he was not influenced. Instead Kim looked at her with dread, as if she were the vibrant village.

"You two are new" said someone behind them. The two stopped and turned abruptly: a relaxed, sandy haired boy. He was a bit older than them. He was holding a cow by a nose ring teather. "Where you from?" the boy looked between Tom and Kim, but ending on Tom.

"Hello." She answered eagerly, pleased to make a new friend. Kim barely said anything, a slight disaproval was his greeting.

"We're from the Forest." Tom pointed North to explain.

"Oh." said the boy as if he was interested. "The forest."

The Tailor's hero's journey and Toms hero's journey

1) Tom
Call to adventure
-- Tom goes with Kim, meets Jack sells him pips for a cow
-- Kim thinks father would be disapointed with a cow and thrash them or something. By the way elsewhere, out of the story, Jacks father is equally disapointed
-- The Tailor meets Tom with Kim and the cow, as Tom and Kim are discussing the situation

2) The Tailor, at the same time has his own heros journey
Call to adventure
- He likes people, but is very fussy over those he spends extended periods with like travelling companions. Selfish, foolhardy or thick people can hurt his eyes. Thick people less than the other qualities though. Selfish or foolhardy behaviours will fail he thinks and doesn't want to see how the failure plays out, or be anywhere near it when it does.
- Tom is a surprise to him, Seeing an urchin in near-wrags (that don't even fit her!) but with sharp and dapper boots 
Refusal of the call
- He thinks it curious, and delightfully unexplainable, but continues walking in the direction he already was and walks past them.
- Kim trying to encourage Tom to make the boots 'go fast' but Tom refusing (Kim wants to get home quickly and the cow is slow). Tom has what is normally hard earnt experience. Impressive.
- The Tailor his back to Tom and Kim having just walked past them slows down walking more slowly, and continues to listen.
- The strange story Tom doesn't really tell about how she got them
- He goes to join them to ask lots of questions.
Trials and tribulations (in threes normally)
- The Tailor asking lots of questions about the giants house, Tom thinks of it as dangerous not intriguing.
- He thinks this young lady has learnt this caution the hard way, but with an encounter of note. He wants to know her story. She is reluctant to remember or talk about something so traumatic.
- Toms reluctance to re-live horror and his willingness and capacity to charm Tom aka influence is his trials << 


NOW THE CLASH LOL
1) hits 2)
Now the Tailor is hooked and wants to know more about Tom, and be her friend. Kim wants to head back home with the cow.

Tom now has an oppotunity to REFUSAL OF THE CALL
The Tailor is Toms SUPERNATURAL AID

Tom can use the word 'adventure' What an adventure! The Tailor might refer to Tom as "Oh! An adventurer!"

Yeah, then the Inn encounter is Toms Crossing the first threshold (the first inn? the one with her and The Tailor?)!!!

3) ?????

4) PROFIT!!!!!!!
