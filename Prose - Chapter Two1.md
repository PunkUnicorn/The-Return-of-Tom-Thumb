# Chapter Two

Tom Thumb had been back home for several nights. As usual her thoughts were occupied, replaying the past troubling days: the terrifying giant, coming to terms with their parents leaving them to die in the forest and finding out she was not the same as her brothers.

She had always known she was not the same, despite her father’s intimidating insistence that he only had sons.

The words of the motherly giant echoed in her thoughts: “Make no mistake you beautiful young thing: you are a girl!” Once again, Tom felt surprise and shock. For as many times as she believed she had come to terms with this, it would return to unsettle her.

She realised that she was not actually looking at the sky, but now she did; her thoughtscape vanished. It would be getting dark soon. The grass stalk in her mouth, she had almost forgotten about it, now chewed to destruction.

Lifting her head to look at what remained of the apple core. The remaining giant apple sat looking a little sorry for itself. It was thinner now, and mushy. She and her brothers had dragged this giant apple from the giants garden a few days ago.

Safe at home, Tom began to reflect on these strange events; back to the moment they decided to take the apple. “I had to persuade everyone.” Tom remembered. “I persuaded them.” she repeated. And as she recalled, she could see her words, back then, had saved them from starvation today. At that moment Tom felt immensely proud.

Weighing the apple up in her mind, she decided it would last two more days. But the heavenly comfort of having enough food for two days came with a nagging feeling. What was that nagging feeling? An awareness catching up with her. Probing her mind, breaking open the block to the thoughts she preferred not to think: “Oh yes,” she murmured; the apple would be completely eaten. 

With no apple left the family would be back to the way it was before. Which was nothing. Winter was not over yet, they might still starve.

With a sigh she pulled herself up to a sit; muscles stretching, which brought her back to the present. The grass stalk in her mouth, now an inconvienince, spat out to make room for thought.

Wiggling her toes she felt the exquisite comfort in the soft leather of her boots; she could do that all day. She had been doing that all day.

“So,” she said to herself, “What I need is a plan.”

It was not an easy problem to solve, but Tom soon had an idea. In fact the answer was clear: get another giant apple! Apples grow from apple pips. “But not in a day”, she sighed, doubting herself. Yet it was something. Tom was struck by a sense of something valuable she had missed; a hidden treasure: the giant apple pips themselves.

Rising to her feet she walked to where the core stood, close enough to judge where the pips could be. Squaring her knuckles with her shoulder, readjusting her footing, channelling body weight, she punched a level blow. A splattering of gloop and a rip into the seed chamber. Gripping the breach with both hands she tore it wider.

Pushing a hand in deeply, she felt a pip. Pushing further, feeling around blindly, she mapped the pip’s orientation. With a concerted shunt the pip nudged to a better grip. Tom curled her hand around the pip’s back and eased it out.

Once she had freed one, another two became accessible: she worked these out and then fitted all three of the large pips into her pockets.
