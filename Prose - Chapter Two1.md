# Chapter Two

Kim held the tether of the cow. Tom waved Jack farewell, who was keen to depart after the transaction. Tom wished Jack had been more social instead of hurrying off. She felt dissatisfied.

Tom scanned the village hoping to see something that would cascade her enthusiasm. The sun was lower in the sky and the crowds had thinned; the day was retiring. She had sold the pips, there was no reason left to stay.

“We'd better head back.” suggested Kim.

Tom was not ready for this. She found an excuse, a reflex born from desperation: “The trail will be dark. Shouldn't we wait till first light?”

Kim looked to the cow, who was even less keen to hurry than Tom. He sighed and did not instantly disagree. Tom could see in Kim's face he had not given up: “Why don't you make your boots 'go fast'?” he countered.

At this exact moment another traveller was walking past. Tom saw him, a well dressed young man. 

Something she and her brother were saying had caught his attention. He had flashed an awkward glance towards Tom, but averted a connection.

He had thought how odd: a pair of urchins in rags, one of which with impeccable boots. They also had that cow the lad Jack was trying to sell all day (for too high a price). “I wonder?” he thought, on all counts. 

On hearing the boy talk about the smart boots 'going fast' he was more than curious. On his long journey there had been nothing interesting for leagues. Glancing at the one with the boots he could see it was a girl not a boy. She noticed his glance, so he looked away, not wanting to intrude. He walked past them. 

Using the remaining light to see ahead, the long road north looked sparse. Also he reckoned it was more bitterly cold. Also he had heard it was dangerous further up. As he walked he made a choice: he would stop, turn around and head back south from where he came. It had been a long venture, starting the previous spring. The months spent travelling north had reached their conclusion. 

So he slowed his steps. He could hear the two with the cow arguing: the girl didn't want to get lost in the forest, the boy wanted to get home; The girl said the boots didn't work like that, the boy getting a little frustrated. Her final gambit: to pleed caution, for fear of getting lost. The boy seeming to be swayed. They stopped talking. 

Our travelling man turned around. He could see the two were still there, he was behind them. The cow did face him however.

He took a few steps towards them. They were silent. He stopped slightly too far away from them; giving them adequate space. With a polite cough he introduced his presents. They turned around. The man bowed slightly, moderately spread his hands as a gesture of openness. 

“Greetings.” he said smiling shyly, more shyly than his snappy clothes and confident posture would have suggested.

"Hello." Tom beemed. Kim stayed silent.
