# Chapter Two

Kim held the tether of the cow. Tom waved Jack farewell, who was keen to depart after the transaction. Tom wished Jack had been more social instead of hurrying off. She felt dissatisfied.

Tom scanned the village hoping to see something that would cascade her enthusiasm. However, the sun was lower in the sky and the crowds had thinned; the day was retiring. She had sold the pips, there was no reason left to stay.

“We'd better head back.” suggested Kim.

Tom was not ready for this. She found an excuse, a reflex born from desperation: “The trail will be dark. Shouldn't we wait till first light?”

Kim looked to the cow, who was even less keen to hurry than Tom. He sighed and did not instantly disagree. Tom could see in Kim's face he had not given up: “Why don't you make your boots 'go fast'?” he countered.

At this exact moment another traveller was walking past. Tom saw him, a well dressed young man. Something she and her brother were saying had caught his attention. He had flashed an awkward glance towards Tom, but averted a connection.

Let us switch to the perspective of this traveller.

He had thought how odd: a pair of urchins in rags, one of which with impeccable boots. They also had that cow the lad Jack was trying to sell all day (for too high a price). “I wonder?” he thought, on all counts. 

On hearing the boy talk about the smart boots 'going fast' he was more than curious. On his long journey there had been nothing interesting for leagues. Glancing at the one with the boots he could see it was a girl not a boy. She noticed his glance, so he looked away, not wanting to intrude. He walked past them. 

Using the remaining light to see ahead, the long road north looked sparse. Also he reckoned it was more bitterly cold. Also he had heard it was dangerous further up. As he walked he made a choice: he would stop, turn around and head back south from where he came. It had been a long venture, starting the previous spring. The months spent travelling north had reached their conclusion. 

So he slowed his steps. He could hear the two with the cow arguing: the girl didn't want to get lost in the forest, the boy wanted to get home; The girl said the boots didn't work like that, the boy getting a little frustrated. Her final gambit: to plead caution, for fear of getting lost. The boy seeming to be swayed. They stopped talking. 

Our travelling man turned around. He could see the two were still there, he was behind them. The cow did face him however.

He took a few steps towards them. They were silent. He stopped slightly too far away from them; giving them adequate space. With a polite cough he introduced his presents. They turned around. The man bowed slightly, moderately spread his hands as a gesture of openness. 

“Greetings.” he said smiling shyly, more shyly than his snappy clothes and confident posture would suggest.

“Hello.” Tom beamed. Kim stayed silent.

“Could, I... possibly ask you... one hundred billion things?” the well dressed man begged as much as unruffled composure would allow.

Tom laughed; this smart, handsome figure fooling around. Kim snorted out enough to give away he found it funny.

“Firstly,” continued the man, “please allow me to introduce myself: I am a humble tailor.” and he bowed slightly.

“I'm Tom.” she completed, then continued: “A tailor?”, she asked impressed, and then more earnest: “Do you really want to ask questions?”

The Tailor took a step forward, nodded to confirm, “Yes.” He paused. “If I could ask one thing that I am curious about: did you buy that cow off that lad Jack?”

Tom was proud of buying the cow; one of her proudest achievements: “Yes.” but she noticed The Tailor was concerned: “Why?”.

The Tailor looked at Tom with regret, gently stating: “All day Jack was asking a rather high price.”, but Tom did not understand. The Tailor seemed to notice, breaking the slight pause by continuing: “I wondered if...  would you share how much the cow cost you?”. The Tailor was aware this was a rude question, but felt concern for the pair.

Tom shrugged: “Three apple pips.“. The Tailor was confused but after some questions he understood: they were from a giant apple. Tom would not share where the apple came from. In fact, she seemed to shut down when asked, she started shrinking away. The Tailor had to divert the conversation to stories of his own travels. This woke Tom up, but not the other one, her brother he presumed.

Tom pressed questions about the south, it's commerce, on cosmopolitan values. Each answer was bit too much for her to grasp, and the questions were numerous. The Tailor answered best he could:
