# Chapter Two

Tom Thumb had been back home for several nights. As usual her thoughts were occupied, replaying the past troubling days: the terrifying giant, coming to terms with their parents leaving them to die in the forest.

The worst, however, was being singled out as a girl in front of her brothers. She had not worried about this before, despite her father’s intimidating insistence he only had sons. But the words of the motherly giant echoed in her thoughts: “Make no mistake, beautiful young thing, under that mess you are a girl!”

Once again, Tom felt the surprise and shock. For all the times she believed she had come to terms with this, it would return to unsettle her.

Glancing up she saw what remained of the giant apple: it was thinner now, and mushy. She and her brothers had dragged this apple from the giant's garden a few days ago.

Safe at home Tom reflected on these strange events, back to the time they decided to take the apple. “My idea.” Tom remembered.

More than ever, she was clear her actions had saved them from starvation. The sense of relief mixed with fear; how close they were to leaving the apple. And yet amongst the fragile relief was a small, glimmering sense of pride.

A second look: she decided the apple would last two more days. But the heavenly comfort of having enough food came with a nagging feeling. What was that nagging feeling? “Oh yes,” she murmured; the apple would inevitably be eaten.

With a sigh she pulled herself up to sit; muscles stretching, which brought her back to the present. The grass stalk in her mouth, now an inconvenience, spat out to make room for thought.

Wiggling her toes she felt the exquisite comfort; the soft leather of her boots. She could do that all day. She had been doing that all day.

“So,” she said to herself, “what I need is a plan.”

It was not an easy problem to solve, but soon Tom had an idea. In fact the answer was clear: get another giant apple! it was something.

And then a moment of inspiration: a hidden treasure she had missed: the giant apple pips themselves.

Rising to her feet she approached the core, it was almost as tall as Tom. Pacing round, estimating the pip's location. Squaring her knuckles she punched a level blow; with a splattering of gloop her fist ripped through the seed chamber. Gripping the breach with both hands, she tore it wider.

Pushing a hand in deeply, she felt a pip. Pushing further, feeling around blindly, she mapped the pip’s orientation. With a concerted shunt the pip shifted to a better grip, and she eased it out.

Once she had freed one, two more became accessible: she got these out and fitted all three of the large pips into her pockets.
