# Chapter Two

Tom Thumb had been back home for several nights. As usual her thoughts were occupied, replaying the past troubling days: the terrifying giant, coming to terms with their parents leaving them to die in the forest and finding out she was not the same as her brothers.

She had always known she was not the same, despite her father’s intimidating insistence that he only had sons.

The words of the motherly giant echoed in her thoughts: “Make no mistake you beautiful young thing: you are a girl!” Once again, Tom felt surprise and shock. For as many times as she believed she had come to terms with this, it would return to unsettle her.

Chewing a grass stalk while her thoughts troubled her, a frosty breeze caught her nose and she realised that she was not actually looking at the sky. But now she began to look, her thoughtscape vanishing; she saw the clouds. It would be getting dark soon.

She lifted her head up to look at what remained of the apple core beyond the house: it sat looking a little sorry for itself; it was thinner now and mushy.

She and her brothers had dragged this giant apple from the strange house a few days previously. Now, safe at home, Tom began to reflect events in sequence: from arriving home, then thinking backwards in time towards when they first decided to roll the apple out of the giant's garden. “I persuaded them.” Tom congratulated herself; the apple was a feast for everyone. “I had to persuade them.” she said again, surpised by the memory of her actions. At that moment she felt immensely proud.

Weighing the apple up in her mind, she decided it would last two more days. But the heavenly comfort of that thought came with a nagging feeling. What was that nagging feeling? An awareness catching up with her; probing her mind, breaking open the block to the thoughts she preferred not to think: “Oh yes,” she murmured; the apple would inevitably be eaten. With no apple left the family would be back to the way it was before. Which was with nothing. Winter was not over yet.

Being the smallest child, (significantly smaller than the next smallest), Tom was not sure that being a girl made any difference. She would still have to fight for pretty much everything.

Somehow, her attention wandered from the apple, even though she was looking straight at it.

Tom’s mind drifted.

Spring would break and the family could get back to a merry life of hunting rodents, served with nettles. How they would banquet on those delicious morsels. But it was just a daydream: a lovely image to savour while she laid on her back.

With a sigh she spat out the grass stalk, pulling herself up to sitting - muscles stretching, which with the chill brought her back to the present.

Wiggling her toes she felt the exquisite comfort in the soft leather of her boots; she could do that all day. She had been doing that all day.

“So,” she said to herself, “What I need is a plan.”

It was not an easy problem to solve, but Tom soon had an idea! In fact the answer was clear: get another giant apple! Apples grow from apple pips. “But not in a day”, she sighed, doubting herself. Yet it was something. Tom was struck by a sense of something valuable; she had uncovered a hidden treasure: the giant apple pips themselves.

Smoothly rising to her feet she walked over to where the core stood, close enough to judge where the pips could be. Squaring her knuckles with her shoulder, readjusting her footing; channelling her body weight she punched a level blow causing a splattering of gloop, but ripping a hole into the seed chamber. Gripping the breach with both hands she tore it wider.

Pushing a hand in deeply, she felt a pip. Pushing further, feeling around blindly, she mapped the pip’s orientation. With a concerted shunt the pip nudged to a better grip. Tom curled her hand around the pip’s back and eased it out.

Once she had freed one, another two became accessible: she worked these out and then fitted all three of the large pips into her pockets.
