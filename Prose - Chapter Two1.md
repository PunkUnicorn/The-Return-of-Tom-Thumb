# Chapter Two

Tom Thumb had been back home for several nights. As usual her thoughts were occupied, replaying the past troubling days: the terrifying giant, coming to terms with their parents leaving them to die in the forest. 

The worst, however, was being singled out as a girl in front of her brothers. It was not something she had worried about, despite her father’s intimidating insistence he only had sons. 

The words of the motherly giant echoed in her thoughts: “Make no mistake, beautiful young thing: under that hair, and those clothes, you are a girl.” Once again, Tom felt surprise and shock. For as many times as she came to terms with this, it would return to unsettle her. 

She was not really looking at the sky, but now she did. Her thoughtscape vanished. It would be getting dark soon. The grass stalk in her mouth, almost forgotten about, chewed to destruction.

Lifting her head to see what remained of the apple core. The remaining giant apple looked thinner now, and mushy. She and her brothers had dragged this giant apple from the giant's garden a few days ago.

Safe at home Tom reflected on these strange events, back to the time they decided to take the apple. “My idea.” Tom remembered.

More than ever, she was clear her actions had saved them from starvation. The sense of relief mixed with fear; how close they were to leaving the apple. And yet amongst the fragile relief was a small, glimmering sense of pride.

A second look: she decided the apple would last two more days. But the heavenly comfort of having enough food came with a nagging feeling. What was that nagging feeling? “Oh yes,” she murmured; the apple would inevitably be eaten.

With no apple left the family would be back to the way it was before. Winter was not over yet, they might still starve.

With a sigh she pulled herself up to sit; muscles stretching, which brought her back to the present. The grass stalk in her mouth, now an inconvenience, spat out to make room for focus.

Wiggling her toes she felt the exquisite comfort in the soft leather of her boots. She could do that all day. She had been doing that all day.

“So,” she said to herself, “what I need is a plan.”

It was not an easy problem to solve, but soon Tom had an idea. In fact the answer was clear: get another giant apple! Apples grow from apple pips. “But not in a day”, she sighed, doubting herself. Yet it was something. Tom was struck by an idea: some value she had missed; a hidden treasure: the giant apple pips themselves.

Rising to her feet she walked to where the core stood, close enough to judge where the pips could be. Squaring her knuckles she punched a level blow. With a splattering of gloop her punch ripped through the seed chamber. Gripping the breach with both hands she tore it wider.

Pushing a hand in deeply, she felt a pip. Pushing further, feeling around blindly, she mapped the pip’s orientation. With a concerted shunt the pip nudged to a better grip. Tom eased it out.

Once she had freed one, two more of the large pips became accessible: she worked these out and fitted all three into her pockets.
