# Chapter Two

Kim held the tether of the cow, Tom waved Jack farewell who was keen to depart after the transaction. Tom wished Jack had been more social, instead of hurrying off. She felt dissatisfied.

Tom scanned the village hoping to see something that would cascade her excitement. The sun was lower in the sky and the crowds had thinned; the day retiring. She had sold the pips, no reason left to stay.

“We'd better head back.” suggested Kim.

Tom was not ready for this. From a desperate reflex she found an excuse: “The trail will be dark. Shouldn't we wait till first light tomorrow?”

Kim looked to the cow, who was even less keen to hurry than Tom. He sighed and did not instantly disagree. Tom could see in Kim's face he had not given up: “Why don't you make your boots 'go fast'?” he countered.

At this exact moment another traveller was walking past. Tom saw him, a well dressed young man. 

Something her and her brother were saying had caught his attention. He had flashed an awkward glance towards Tom, but averted a connection.

The man had thought how odd: a pair of urchins in rags, one of which with impeccable boots. They also had that cow the lad Jack was trying to sell all day (for too high a price). “I wonder?” he thought, on all counts. 

On hearing the boy talk about the smart boots 'going fast' he was more than curious. On his long journey there had been nothing interesting for leagues. Glancing at the one with the boots he could see it was a girl not a boy. She noticed his glance, so he looked away, not wanting to intrude. He walked past them. 

Using the remaining light to see ahead, the long road north looked cold and sparse. Also he reckoned it was more bitterly cold north, and he had heard it was dangerous too. As we walked north he made a choice, that he would stop, turn around and head back south from where he came. It had been a long route north. The months spent travelling north had reached their conclusion. 

So he slowed his steps. He could hear the two with the cow arguing: the girl didn't want to get lost in the forest, the boy wanted to get home; The girl said the boots didn't work like that: the boy seeming to be swayed. They stopped talking. He turned around. The two were still there but he was behind them. The cow faced him.

He took a few steps towards them. They were silent. He stopped some distance from them; giving them adequate space. With a polite cough he introducing his presents. They turned around. The man bowed slightly, moderately spread his hands as a gesture of openness. 

“Hello” he smiled, more shyly than his stance and confident posture would expect.
