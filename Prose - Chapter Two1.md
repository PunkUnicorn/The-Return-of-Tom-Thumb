# Chapter Two

Tom Thumb had been back home for several nights. As usual her thoughts were occupied, replaying the past few days: the terrifying giant, their parents leaving them to die in the forest.

The worst, however, was being singled out as a girl. Never a problem before, despite her father’s intimidating insistence that he only had sons, her femininity obvious to her brothers forever. Their violent father, howeverm only really cared about his ale, which you dare not get in the way of. Tom had gotten very good at staying out of his way.

But the words of the motherly giant echoed in her thoughts: “You think you can hide it? Oh, beautiful young thing. You can't hide it. You're growing up too fast.”. Tom felt the surprise and shock again. For all the times she thought she had come to terms with this it returned to unsettle her.

Disturbing thoughts chased her focus but she knew where they went, so she shut them down and looked at the giant apple. It sat yards away, at least what remained of it did. She and her brothers had dragged this apple from the giant’s garden. Tom reflected on those strange events: the apple in front of her was undeniable evidence. No longer the regal apple they stole, it half eaten and dry.

Stretching her ankles, pulling her toes to a point she felt the exquisite comfort of her warm, soft leather boots. Still a very new sensation. She could do that all day. She had been doing that all day.

So she let that comfort go. There was a sense of something frightening. But what was it? The apple would keep them fed for two more days, they had enough food, life was good. But there was a panic somewhere. And then she remembered: “It's only going to last two more days.”

She had held back concern for too long, and now it flooded her, unable to hold back the awareness that time might defeat them. Any idea of a solution would do, but what? Another giant apple would solve the hunger problem. It was something. And then a moment of inspiration, a hidden treasure she had missed: the giant apple pips.

Jumping to her feet she hurried towards the apple. It was taller than her. Walking around it she found a likely spot. She squared her knuckles and punched a level blow, ripping through into the seed chamber.

She felt a pip. It was slippery. For better leverage she stretched her arm as far as possible. She blindly mapped the pip's orientation. With a shunt she carefully eased the pip out. Feeling triumphant she freed another two. After drying each of them she fitted the three large pips into her pockets.
