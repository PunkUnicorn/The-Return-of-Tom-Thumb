# Chapter Two

Tom Thumb had been back home for several nights.

As usual her thoughts were occupied replaying the past troubling days. The terrifying giant; coming to terms with their parents leaving them to die in the forest: and finding out she was not the same as her brothers. 

She had known this, despite her father’s intimidating insistence he only had boys. The words of the motherly giant echoed in her thoughts: “Make no mistake you beautiful young thing: you are a girl.”, and again Tom felt surprise and shock. For as many times as she came to terms with this, it would return to unsettle her.

Chewing a grass stalk, her arms behind her head, a frosty breeze caught her nose and she realised she was not looking at the sky. But now she did. Her thoughtscape vanished and she saw the clouds. It would be getting dark soon.

She pulled her head up to look at the remaining apple core beyond the house: it sat looking a little sorry for itself; it was more than thin now, and slushy. 

She and her brothers had dragged this giant apple from the strange house. “What a great idea that was.” Tom congratulated herself; it was a feast for everyone. “That was me.” she continued surprised. At that moment she felt immensely proud.

The apple would last two more days; weighing it up in her mind. Full bellies all round. A heavenly comfort but with a nagging feeling. What was that nagging feeling? An awareness catching up with her. 

Probing her thoughts, reluctantly opening blocks: “Oh yes,” she murmured; the apple would inevitably be eaten. With no apple left the family would be back to the way it was before. Which was nothing. Winter was not over yet.

Being the smallest child, (significantly smaller than the next smallest), Tom was not sure that being a girl made any difference. She would still have to fight for pretty much anything.

Somehow, her focus left the apple even though she was looking straight at it. 

Tom’s mind drifted.

Spring would break and the family could get back to a merry life of hunting rodents for meals, served with nettles. A banquet. But just a daydream. A lovely image while she laid on her back. 

With a sigh, and the biting cold descending, she pulled herself up to sit; muscles stretching, which with the chill brought her back to the present.

Wiggling her toes, she felt the exquisite comfort in the soft leather of the boots; she could do that all day. She had been doing that all day. 

“So,” she said to herself, “What I need is a plan.” 

It was not an easy problem to solve, but quickly Tom had an idea! In fact the answer was clear: get another giant apple. Apples grow from apple pips. “But not in a day.”, disagreeing with herself. It was something. Tom understood there was a hidden treasure: the giant apple pips. 

Gently rising to her feet she walked to the core, close enough to judge where the pips could be. Squaring her knuckles with her shoulder, readjusting her footing; channelling body weight, she punched a level blow, ripping a small hole into the seed chamber. Gripping the breach with both hands she tore it wider.

Pushing a hand in deeply, she felt a pip. Pushing further, feeling around blindly, she mapped the pip’s orientation. With a concerted shunt the pip nudged to a better grip. Tom curled her hand around the pip’s back and eased it out.

Once she had freed one, another two became accessible: she worked these out and fitted all three of the large pips in her pockets.
