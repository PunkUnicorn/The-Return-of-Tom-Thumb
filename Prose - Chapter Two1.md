# Chapter Two

Tom Thumb had been back home for several nights. As usual her thoughts were occupied, replaying the past few days: the terrifying giant, their parents leaving them to die in the forest.

The worst, however, was being singled out as a girl. Never a problem before, despite her father’s intimidating insistence he only had sons, her femininity obvious to her brothers. Their violent father, however, was oblivious, spending her entire life drunk. You dare not get in the way of his ale. Tom had gotten very good at staying out of his way.

But the words of the motherly giant echoed in her thoughts: “You think you can hide it? Oh, beautiful young thing. You're growing up too fast. You can't hide it.”. Tom felt the surprise and shock again. For all the times she thought she had come to terms with this, it returned to unsettle her.

Disturbing thoughts chased her focus. She shut them down and looked at the giant apple. It sat yards away, at least what remained of it. She and her brothers had dragged this apple from the giant’s garden. Tom reflected on those strange events: the apple in front of her was undeniable evidence. No longer the regal apple they stole, it was half eaten and dry.

Stretching her ankles, pulling her toes to a point, she felt the exquisite comfort of her new, soft leather boots. She could do that all day. She had been doing that all day.

She let the comfort go. There was a sense of something frightening. But what was it? The apple would keep them fed for probably two more days, they had enough food, life was good. But there was an illusive dread. And then she remembered: “It's only going to last a few more days.”

She had ignored concern, but now it flooded her: starvation might defeat them yet. Any idea of a solution would do, but what? Another giant apple would solve the hunger problem. It was something. And then a moment of inspiration, a hidden treasure she had missed: the giant apple pips.

Jumping to her feet she hurried towards the apple. It was taller than her. Walking around it she found a likely spot. She squared her knuckles and punched a level blow, ripping into the seed chamber.

She felt a pip. It was slippery. Wriggling for better leverage she angled her body and stretched her arm as far as possible. Blindly mapping the pip's orientation, with a shunt, she carefully eased the pip out. Feeling triumphant she freed another two. After drying each of the pips she put them in her pockets.
