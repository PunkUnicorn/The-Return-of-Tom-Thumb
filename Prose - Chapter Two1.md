# Chapter Two

Tom Thumb had been back home for several nights. As usual her thoughts were occupied, replaying the past troubling days: the terrifying giant, coming to terms with their parents leaving them to die in the forest.

The worst, however, was being singled out as a girl in front of her brothers. She had not worried about this before, despite her father’s intimidating insistence he only had sons. But the words of the motherly giant echoed in her thoughts: “Make no mistake you beautiful young thing, there's no hiding it.”

Tom felt the surprise and shock again. For all the times she believed she had come to terms with this, it would return to unsettle her.

Needing a distraction she glanced up to see what remained of the giant apple: it was thinner now, and mushy. She and her brothers had dragged this apple from the giant’s garden a few days ago.

Safe at home Tom reflected on these strange events, back to the time they decided to take the apple. “My idea.” she remembered.

More than ever, Tom was aware her actions had saved them from starvation. The sense of relief was mixed with the anxiety of how close they were to leaving it behind. And yet amongst the fragile relief was a small, glimmering sense of pride; she had persuaded her brothers.

But now she had to focus on the present, which drew her attention back to the apple. It would probably last two more days. The heavenly comfort of having enough food came with a nagging feeling. What was that nagging feeling? “Oh,” she thought, “it's only going to last two days.”

Wiggling her toes she felt the exquisite comfort in the soft leather of her boots. She could do that all day. She had been doing that all day.

With a sigh she pulled herself up to sit. The grass stalk in her mouth, now an inconvenience, spat out. She had to think.	

“What I need is some kind of plan.”, she thought.

Soon Tom had an idea, in fact the answer was clear: get another giant apple! it was something.

And then a moment of inspiration: a hidden treasure she had missed: the giant apple pips themselves.

Jumping to her feet she walked quickly towards the core, it was almost as tall as her. Pacing round, estimating the pip's location she spotted a likely spot. Squaring her fist she punched a level blow. With a splattering of gloop her calloused knuckes ripped through the seed chamber. Gripping the breach she tore it wider.

Pushing a hand in deeply, the pulp giving way between her fingers, she felt a pip. Pushing further, feeling around blindly, she mapped the pip's orientation. With a concerted shunt it shifted to a better grip, and she eased it out.

Once she had freed one, two more became accessible: she fitted all three of the large pips in her pockets.
