# Chapter Two

Tom Thumb had been back home for several nights. As usual her thoughts were occupied, replaying the past few days: the terrifying giant, their parents leaving them to die in the forest.

The worst, however, was being singled out as a girl in front of her brothers. It had not been a problem before, despite her father’s intimidating insistence he only had sons. But the words of the motherly giant echoed in her thoughts: “You think you can hide it? Oh, beautiful young thing, you can't hide it.”

Tom felt the surprise and shock again. For all the times she believed she had come to terms with this, it returned to unsettle her.

The disturbing thought chased her focus, but she was quicker; giving her attention to the giant apple. It sat yards away, at least what remained of it. 

She and her brothers had dragged this apple from the giant’s garden. Tom reflected on those strange events. The apple in front of her was undeniable evidence of the past few days. It looked at her half eaten, mushy round the edges; not the regal apple it started as.

Stretching her ankles, pulling her toes to a point, she felt the exquisite comfort of warm, soft leather in her new boots. She could do that all day. She had been doing that all day.

So she let her comfort go and returned to the present. There was a sense of something frightening here. But what was it? The apple would keep them fed for two more days, they had enough food, life was good. But there was a feeling. 

And then she remembered: “It's only going to last for two more days.”

Concerned, and feeling like time could defeat her, any idea would do. But what? Another giant apple would solve the hunger problem. It was something. And then a moment of inspiration, a hidden treasure she had missed: the giant apple pips.

Jumping to her feet she hurried towards the apple. It was almost as tall as her. Walking around it she found a likely spot. She squared her knuckles and punched a level blow, ripping through into the seed chamber.

She felt a pip. It was slippery. For better leverage she stretched her arm as far as possible. She blindly mapped the pip's orientation. With a shunt she nudged the pip to a better grip, and then carefully eased the pip out. Feeling triumphant, she freed another two. After drying each of them on the front of her jumper she fitted all three of the large pips into her pockets.
