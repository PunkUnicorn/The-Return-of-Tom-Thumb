# Chapter Two

Kim held the tether of the cow and Tom waved Jack farewell. Jack was keen to depart after the transaction. He left quickly siting mis-matched excuses. Tom wished Jack had been more social instead of hurrying off. Despite now owning a cow she felt dissatisfied.

Tom scanned the village hoping to see something that would cascade her excitement. The sun was lower in the sky and the crowds had thinned, the day retiring. With the purpose for her journey spent, there was nothing left to justify staying. 

“We'd better head back.” suggested Kim.

Tom was not ready for this. With a reflex from desperation she found an excuse: “The trail will be dark. Shouldn't we wait till first light tomorrow?”

Kim looked to the cow, who was even less keen to hurry than Tom. He sighed and did not instantly disagree. Tom could see in Kim's face he had not given up: “Why don't you make your boots 'go fast'?” he countered.

At this exact moment another traveler was walking past. Tom saw him: a well dressed young man. Something her and her brother were saying had caught his attention and he flashed an awkward glance towards Tom as Kim said that but averted a connection.

The man had thought how odd: a pair of urchins in wrags, one of which with impeccable boots. They also had that cow the lad Jack was trying to sell (for too high a price) all day. “I wonder how how?” he thought, on all counts. 

On hearing the boy talk about the smart boots 'going fast' he was more curious than he had been for a long time. There had been nothing for leagues this side of the far north as interesting as this pair of teenagers. Glancing at the one with the boots he could see it was a girl not a boy. He walked past them. 

Using the remaining light to see ahead, the long road north looked cold and sparce. Also he rekoned it was more cold and dull than the trail leading up to it; possibly dangerous too (he had heard.) 

This was because he was alert, wise and clever. 

He slowed his steps to decelerated his distance northwards. He could hear the two with the cow arguing: the girl didn't want to get lost in the forest, the boy wanted to get home; The girl said the boots didn't work like that: the boy seeming to be swayed her way. They stopped talking. He turned around. The two were still there but he was behind them. The cow faced him.

He took a few steps towards them introducing himself with a polite cough, some distance between them; giving them adequate space. They turned around. 

The man bowed slightly, moderately spread his hands apart as a gesture of openness. “Hello” he smiled, more shyly than his stance and confident posture would expect.

The Tailor's hero's journey and Toms hero's journey

1) Tom
Call to adventure
-- Kim thinks father would be disapointed with a cow? and thrash them or something. By the way elsewhere, out of the story, Jacks father is equally disapointed
-- The Tailor meets Tom with Kim and the cow, as Tom and Kim are discussing the situation

2) The Tailor, at the same time has his own heros journey
Call to adventure
- He likes people, but is very fussy over those he spends extended periods with like travelling companions. Selfish, foolhardy or thick people can hurt his eyes. Thick people less than the other qualities though. Selfish or foolhardy behaviours will fail he thinks and doesn't want to see how the failure plays out, or be anywhere near it when it does.
- Tom is a surprise to him, Seeing an urchin in near-wrags (that don't even fit her!) but with sharp and dapper boots 
Refusal of the call
- He thinks it curious, and delightfully unexplainable, but continues walking in the direction he already was and walks past them.
- Kim trying to encourage Tom to make the boots 'go fast' but Tom refusing (Kim wants to get home quickly and the cow is slow). Tom has what is normally hard earnt experience. Impressive.
- The Tailor his back to Tom and Kim having just walked past them slows down walking more slowly, and continues to listen.
- The strange story Tom doesn't really tell about how she got them
- He goes to join them to ask lots of questions.
Trials and tribulations (in threes normally)
- The Tailor asking lots of questions about the giants house, Tom thinks of it as dangerous not intriguing.
- He thinks this young lady has learnt this caution the hard way, but with an encounter of note. He wants to know her story. She is reluctant to remember or talk about something so traumatic.
- Toms reluctance to re-live horror and his willingness and capacity to charm Tom aka influence is his trials << 


NOW THE CLASH LOL
1) hits 2)
Now the Tailor is hooked and wants to know more about Tom, and be her friend. Kim wants to head back home with the cow.

Tom now has an oppotunity to REFUSAL OF THE CALL
The Tailor is Toms SUPERNATURAL AID

Tom can use the word 'adventure' What an adventure! The Tailor might refer to Tom as "Oh! An adventurer!"

Yeah, then the Inn encounter is Toms Crossing the first threshold (the first inn? the one with her and The Tailor?)!!!

3) ?????

4) PROFIT!!!!!!!
