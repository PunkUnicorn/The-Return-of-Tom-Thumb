# Chapter Two

Tom Thumb had been back home for several nights. As usual her thoughts were occupied, replaying the past few days: the terrifying giant, their parents leaving them to die in the forest.

The worst, however, was being singled out as a girl in front of her brothers. It had not been a problem before, despite her father’s intimidating insistence he only had sons. But the words of the motherly giant echoed in her thoughts: “You think you can hide it? Oh, beautiful young thing, you can't hide it.”

Tom felt the surprise and shock again. For all the times she believed she had come to terms with this, it returned to unsettle her.

Distracting herself, she glanced to see what remained of the giant apple: it was thinner now, and mushy. She and her brothers had dragged this apple from the giant’s garden. Tom reflected on those strange events, to the time they decided to take the apple; it was her idea, they had almost left it behind.

Stretching her ankles, pulling her toes to a point, she felt the exquisite comfort in the soft leather of her boots. She could do that all day. She had been doing that all day.

Reluctantly, letting go of comfort, her awareness started to return to the present. In the present, there was a sense of something frightening. But what was it? The apple would keep them fed for two more days, they had enough food, life was good. But there was a nagging feeling. 

And then she remembered: “it's only going to last more two days.”, and then they would all get hungry again.

Suddenly she had an idea: another giant apple would solve the hunger problem. It was something. And then a moment of inspiration; a hidden treasure she had missed: the giant apple pips.

Jumping to her feet, she hurried towards the apple. It was almost as tall as her. She paced around, looking for a good place to start. As quickly as she found a likely spot, she squared her knuckles and punched a level blow, her fist ripping into the seed chamber. Gripping the breach, she tore it wider.

Sticking her arm in she felt a pip. Pushing further, as far as possible, she mapped the pip's orientation. With a concerted shunt she shifted the pip to a better grip and eased it out. Feeling triumphant she freed another two, then fitted all three of the large pips into her pockets.
