`Requires only Tom and The Tailor and no other companion`

`Requires Tom and The Tailor to be not well acquainted`

Tom and The Tailor encounter their first inn. Tom's never been to an inn before but does not share this with The Tailor. Tom notices the inn door has a latch. 

"I know how to work that" she says impressed with herself, sharing - needing to put a proud front on to keep up with this dazzling stranger, The Tailor

"After you then" The Tailor would accommodate, overlooking Tom's un-learned obvservation. The Tailor would enjoy hearing the pride in Toms voice.

Inside the tavern Tom would be overwhelmed.

At the bar, drinking ale Tom and The Tailor would chatter, The Tailor bringing in any overhearer seeming to hook them almost. Soon most adjacent would be engaged. 

(The Tailor might have to pop out and leave Tom alone.) Tom would say something stupid due to being feral
- Tom is impressed with coins, she has never seen a coin, and there are so many
- Tom is dressed really badly, before The Tailor has had a chance to alter anything
- Toms vocabulary is limited at this point

Everyone listening would laugh at the stupid thing Tom says, like "I've never seen such an amazing place" in the dankest ale-squat this side of the North, where people come specifically not to care.

Tom would try to recover with an attempt at a complement (accidentally being facetious about the patrons or the innkeeper or something "Uh such a happy house! the innkeeper is obviously well fed"), but whatever she does to recover gets more laughs (possibly offending the innkeeper) and sensitive, she hides away best she can, unsuccessfully and hoping no-one is looking (they all are). Each of her steps the hopeful one that hides her, but none do and the crowd are all facing her lauging. An intense  focus on her. slowly and not-impolitely, She leaves. 

She's sad that she doesn't know how to fit in with towns-folk, like The Tailor. She is unsurprised at her failure; it makes alot of sense. She has to move on.

She walks slowly along the south trail on her own. She's gone a good few steps but not far enough as she hears the inn doors open and close. 

The Tailor looks around and sees Tom. He skips to a jog to catch up, reaches Tom ot walk along side her, matching her pace step for step. Tom looks at The Tailor and The Tailor holds a steady gaze back as he skips a step to rejoin Toms exact pace. The Tailors matching of footing speaking volumes in the silence. 

Laughing at the delight of the foolish simple game Tom realises The Tailor might enjoy her company and they continue on the trail arm in arm.

They make a camp fire and stay up all night tending the flames. Tom explains enough about the boots to The Tailor that he understands them to be Seven League Boots.


Summary:
Tom is now bonded with The Tailor
The Tailor is now in position as friend and mentor to fill this. She will start using The Tailors vocabulary
Seven League Boots now ready to be used to hoof the two southwards and meet the others
