# The Compass Device
- This is a hat, with a feather in which points to a location you describe. 
- It is triggered by wearing it, like the hat of invisibility.
- It makes you feel like going in the direction of what you want, with the caviat that along the way it has it's own agenda .. and if you don't want anything you are driven by what the feathrer wants
- 
- There are variations of this hat with history x, constructed in the era y, by the great wizard z and is referenced in folklore as known by The Tailor
  - One variation is a feather from a honey bird (honey guide), which points to your desired thing but also every piece of honey in between
  - They always have an annoying quirk like this, depending on what it's a feather of. That's why you can find them, because people stop wearing them because they're fun to start with but get annoying
  - Magpie feather would get you to where you want but slightly side track you constantly towards the nearest shiney thing, possibly valuable, deffinately shiney
  - Sometimes some feathers would to towards the nearest water pool/stream
