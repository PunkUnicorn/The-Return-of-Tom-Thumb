- [x] Only The Tailor and Tom are present
- [x] The Tailor and Tom don't know each other very well

The Tailor would ask tom questions about hyperthetical situations of the (pointness) gain, probably material, if Tom used the boots with abandon

Tom has low standards of comfort so she would not be tempted, enjoying the present and introverted joys

The Tailor would be outstandingly impressed with this response in Tom
  - He has gotton board of the folly of powerful magical items used by Man in a blind hurry
  - Tom is cautious and respects the power of the boots, and on the whole appreciates the comfort more
  - He appreciates the adventure of the moment and Tom and an innocent does too
  - And she's very quick. Be it not very well edjucated
  - Note: The Tailor needs time away from people, especially since he is such a social extrovert. Tom is easy company for him during these times; she's quiet and non-judgemental.

  - Tom looses something precious, which can be back written, perpahs something Kim gave Tom before their split.
    It could be lost, and Tom *chooses* not to claim it back (taken by a smaller child, stolen by someone in need... etc), and in this trail, and self sacrifice The Tailor would be inpressed.

Summary:
- The Tailor respects Tom significantly and would follow her probably anywhere
