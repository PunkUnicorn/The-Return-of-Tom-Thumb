Tom Thumb had been back home for several nights. As usual her thoughts occupied, replaying the past several troubling days. The terrifying giant, comming to terms with her parents leaving them to die in the forest. And finding out she wasn't the same as her brothers. Tom wondered how the lady giant knew. A pang of regret that it was heard from a stranger, but it blended into the regret felt from being left in the forest.

Tom had no reason to doubt the words of the kind woman giant "No you beautiful young thing. Make no mistake you are a girl", and actually it make sense. The words echoed in her thoughts and again Tom felt surprise and shock. Since her first night back at home the kind giants words had said themselves in her mind over and over, and they sometimes brought the heavy feeling in her gut. The shock. For as many times Tom had come to terms with this, it would return to unsettle her.

Chewing a grass-stalk with her arms behind her head she realised she was not actually looking at the sky. But now she did as her thoughtscape vanished and the clouded sky in front of her. Soon it would start to get dark she thought. 

Pulling her head up with her arms Tom looked past their home the remaining apple core. It sat looking a little sorry for it's self. It was more thin and slushy. Her and her brothers had dragged this giant apple from the giants house, it was a feast for the large family.  Everyone had had their fill for the last few days. There was still plenty of apple, it would last them about two more days Tom thought carefully, weighing it up in her mind. 

The whole family had full bellies but Tom knew this would not last. The apple would inevitably all be eaten, in two perhaps three days. After then would be no apple left and the family would be back to what we had before Tom thought, which was nothing. Winter was not over yet. It would be a while till spring. Ahh spring and while she was looking at the apple core she started to think of spring.

Soon the season would break and the family could get back to a merry life of hunting rodents for meals, served with nettles. A banquite Tom thought. But just a daydream. With a sign she pulled her mind back, returning to the present and pulled her self up to a sitting possition. Wiggling her toes she felt the equisit comfort in the soft leather of the boots, she could do that all day. She had been doing that all day. Now the worry of what would happen when the apple core ran out.

After the apple core had gone and there was nothing else to eat Tom knew it would be bad. There would be arguing at best. Believe me, arguing was one of the best results when people are hungry. Being the smallest of all the children, significantly smaller than the next smallest, Tom wasn't sure being a girl made such a difference to anything anyway. Surely she would still have to fight for pretty much anything. Sitting and not sure whether to get up or not, she was glad everyone had enough to eat today. Today she had the luxury of a full belly so it was her time to think clearly, because when everyone gets hungry...... 

So, she said to herself. I know this. What I need to think what to do. So we are all fed, and not hungry in two nights. It was not an easy problem to solve. As she was thinking that Tom had an idea! In face, the answer was clear! Get another giant apple. Looking back at the giant core in front of her Tom could see what she needed. The apple pips. 

Getting to her feet she walked to the core until she was close enough to look where the pips could be. Tom pushed her hand into a likely spot and felt the hard pip. Reaching in for a grip she pulled out a giant apple pip, and once she pulled one giant apple pip out another two became accessable. She got the three and put them in her pockets.
