Tom Thumb had been back at the family house for several nights now. The events at the giants house not settling in her mind well. What with being chased by a terrifying giant, having to come to terms with her parents leading her (and her brothers) to die in the forest. And especially being told by a giant that she was a girl. Tom had no reason to doubt the words of the giant "No beautiful young lady, make no mistake you are a girl", and actually it made sense of quite a few things. Why was one giant kind and the other so mean? Tom thought how nice it would be to live with that giant lady, how nice she was and the smell and taste of her bread.

Chewing a grass-stalk, arms behind her head looking up at the clouds she strained to pull her head up and see what was happening. The remaining apple core sat looking more thin and slushy. Everyone had had their fill for the day. Looking at the apple core she weighed it up in her mind. There was still plenty of apple, it would last them about two more days. Tom had been thinking about this since they arrived back. While the whole family had full bellies since then Tom knew the apple was only good for a few more days and after that they would be back to what they had before, which was nothing. Winter was not over yet.

Soon the season would break and the family could get back to a merry life of hunting rodents for meals, served with nettles. A banquite Tom thought. But just a daydream. Tom pulled herself up, mind returning to the present she sat looking at the giant apple core. Wiggling her toes she felt again the equisit comfort in the soft leather of the boots, she could do that all day. She had been doing that all day. Now the worry of being hungry two nights away was starting to catch up. After the apple core had gone and there was nothing else to eat it would be bad. It would be arguing at best. Believe me, arguing was one of the best pass-times of those available to the family when everyone was hungry. 

Being the smallest of all the children, significantly smaller than the next smallest Tom wasn't sure being a girl made a difference to anything. Surely she would still have to fight for pretty much anything anyway. Sitting and not sure if to get up, she was glad everyone had enough to eat. Now was her time to think clearly because when everyone gets hungry, well. 

Enough! She said to herself. I know all this, what I need to think how to solve us all hungry in two nights. The answer was clear. Get another apple core. And looking again back at their giant core she finally got herself to her feet and walked to the core, seeing exactly what she needed to achieve this. The apple pips. Up close Tom could see one, and once she pulled one giant apple pip out another two became accessable. She got the three and put them in her pockets. She would have to share
