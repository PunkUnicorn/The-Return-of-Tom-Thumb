The Return of Tom Thumb (and the Seven League Boots)

Once upon a time in a land far far away lived a woodcutter and his wife and seven children. They were poor and illiterate living to survive each day and always surprised by winter. One such winter, an especially cold winter the woodcutter and his wife were both ever so cold and oh so hungry. So cold and so hungry they feared they would starve to death. Unable to sleep, wrought with troubles and certain of the grim they decided the best of the worst solutions was to lead their children to the deep forest where they could die out of earshot.

In the morning the father took the seven children to the forest to collect kindling. The seven children did what their father said from fear of being thrashed. “Come on boys” he said and they all followed. But Tom Thumb, the youngest and smallest of the children noticed some things were unusual. It was unusual to collect kindling so early. Why were all the children going? Usually just a few of them went, and they were not talking the usual route. However Tom kept silent as was often the best way when dealing with father..

Tom dwelt on the unusual but also had other troubles. Because the others were bigger they would often be far in front leaving Tom behind. Without the familiar route and with so many siblings out at once Tom decided to leave a trail to follow home. Tom searched all pockets but the only thing to be found was a crust of stale bread. Needing something the crust was crumbled up so Tom could leave breadcrumbs at key locations to be able to navigate back.

They walked and walked, and walked. And they walked. And they walked till they thought they could walk no more. Toms had to leave sparcer and sparcer breadcrumb clues and they had almost run out when dusk came. Suddenly one of the children noticed somehow, none of them quite knew how, olr when, but somehow their father was nowhere to be seen. 

Tom didn't call out for their father like the others, instead instantly rushed to look for the breadcrumb clues. The sparce breadcrumbs had been eaten quickly by birds and the only trace left was a small bird searching for the last crumb. A sinking feeling as a chance to get home was stolen, hope robbed. Tom turned towards the other brothers who were arguing. Following their squabbling Tom returned to the group.

Arguing would get them nowhere, no doubt they would perish unless they found or made shelter. Perhaps they could lean branches together to make a crude hovel? And they may be able to make a fire by working together, the strong ones rubbing sticks and others pooling pocket lint for tinder. And then Tom had an idea.. anyone else in the forest would have a fire for warmth. A slim chance but it was easy to climb a tree and look for light, since it was dark a light in any clearing would shine out. 

A slim chance for sure but easy to do, and critically, all of them together, all the brothers could do both. Make a shelter, make a fire and look for other camp fires. Now it was more than two things, the list was getting out of hand. It was time to share ideas with Kim, the one others will listen to.

Tom called out to the oldest brother Kim.

"I have an idea" Tom said

"To find father?" Kim replied

Tom paused. Tom could see Kim was not considering father had gone. Poor Kim had not learnt to be self sufficient like Tom. As the smallest Tom was first to be forgotten or left behind. But the other brothers could fight more easily for a better place or better things, or to get to the front. Kim the tallest and oldest would be the one who looked out for Tom though and they were very fond of each other. Kim however was not the smartest. Being the oldest Kim got fathers attention so he still very much looked to their father for approval.

Tom inched closer to Kim continuing "Someone climb a tree and look for a light. If we see any, it could be shelter for us" Tom sidelined the question. "If there's no light then we are going to have to build a fire. Probably a shelter too"

Kim trusted Tom and the other brothers trusted Kim, they all got to work some collecting fallen branches for shelter and kindling for a fire. Another brother quick as he could started climbing a tree with good branches. Tom watched him pull himself from branch to branch. It took a long long time. As the brother got higher he had to shout down to be heard. The shouts got more distant and then they couldn't hear anything. A while passed and some brothers began to worry. None on the ground spoke, especially Tom. 

It was Toms idea. 

Everyone had finished collecting good branches and fire material but they had all stopped waiting for the brother who climbed the tree. Tom thought to speak and say something but suddenly a shout from the high branches. Relief below they looked up and the brother was climbing down. 

"Did you see anything?" many shouted up as the brother came into view from above. He didn't answer as he descended, he was climbing down quickly. By the time he got to the trunk he was too exhausted to speak. "Yh" he nodded and the answer "Yes" was clear. Fighting to catch his breath the others gathered round as he wiped the sweat off his head, ragged body exhausted and slumped against the trunk. He pointed in a direction and Tom took a careful mental note which way it was.

"And..." he wheezed excitedly but was too out of breath to continue.

The others waited wondering what else it could be. His panting became less frantic and he got his breath. "And its close" he finished.
