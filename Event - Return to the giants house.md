- [x] All four heros are present

## Call to adventure
- Reason is easy, The Tailor if no one else has heard of this mythical place, the giant's house.
- Also hearing of Jacks exploits everyone is worried about the giant. Perhaps that's why they go, The Tailor would like to check they're ok having been swamped and trolled by rag-dressed children all the time.
--* The Knight would prefer to travel north anyway, to hide away and be invisible.
--* Why would Red go? For kicks? Probably... what do you give the girl that has everything?

## Refusal of the call
At least Tom is reluctant, possibly others. The place sounds ridiculous at best and dangerous at worst. Also the expansive forest brings its own dangers: you might get lost to death.

## Supernatural aid
The equipment they need, a balloon, with a basket for the four of them could become available in a convenient way, perhaps already obvious. It could be a balloon with a basket and it's powered by music. Music makes it go up and can bias the direction depending on the angle the music is coming from below the balloon.

- Also the giants house is half in the plane of clouds, so a balloon, if they go high enough in it, could theoretically reach it. The high clouds are too thin on air though, so it's difficult to play music.

## Crossing the first threshold
## Travelling to the expansive forest
- Could drop in on Kim

## Belly of the whale
- The expansive forest is expansive. They could get lost even floating above it all.

## Trials and tribulations
- It might take longer than they thought. They would have to stop to re-supply. The balloon would land on the tree tops and Tom would use a rope to anchor the balloon and climb down using both the rope and the tree.

- She would catch rodents and gather nettles. The Tailor and The Knight get down easily but they have to make a rope ladder (Tom does) before Red can climb down. They do this at daybreak, since night time is the time to search for the giant's house due to it's illuminations. 

Here they could tell stories as they build a fire and cook

Before it gets dark they assend the rope ladder and get to the balloon.
Getting dark, this is when the giants house lands on the material plane (only at night but not every night)

The giant's house flashes in with sunset. They notice the flash from the height of the balloon, but it is far away.

The balloon has a tear from where they anchored the ballon, 'resting' on the harsh tree-tops of the forest as they made port for the day. 

Itâ€™s easy to repair but would take time. The balloon might slowly descend due to the tear, despite The Tailor playing his flute faster and faster to try and get them up. The balloon will break through the tree tops and get more ripped as the basket of the balloon blindly breaks through, shearing branches to jagged edges which rip the balloon fabric. It dangles from the tree-top, the balloon requiring significantly longer to repair.

They descide to abandon the balloon since getting it repaired, and back through the tree tops, seems like a huge task now. They would spend time trying to repair it if they had the time. They have to hurry towards the direction house, as they remember it. They they make it through, and the giant woman is there in the garden... possibly.. 

but wait!

## Second Refusal of the call
Tom might be reluctant, nervous to see the giant again. She might mention this but she might resolve it internally, silently.

## Second Supernatural aid
The Tailor would know the ancient protocols for initiating a conversation with the giants, from the older times; the giant wars all but forgotten and melded into myth. It might be a phrase he says, or a ryhme. 

What ever it is, it causes dialogue between the giant and the group.

...

They might stay in the house for more than morning, having to wait till the house arrives back to the material. Otherwise they would have to get from the plane of clouds to the material on their own or with the help of the giant. 

The Tailor might have to make a giants suit. He could unroll giant fabric bolt and cut slices to size with his sword. He might employ some magic to overcome the scale of engineering. The giant might provide the use of a magic item from his collection, like something that makes two or four more The Tailors who can all work symultaniously. Or The Tailor might cast this magic himself. Dunno, anyway

Tom would offer the boots back, and appologise. 

The seven league boots were, Mr Giant admits, the most comfortable of all the magic boots he's worn.

Giant asks: "What did you do with them?"

Tom says how they helped her see the land. She couldn't have escaped her home without them.

Because she has nothing but integrity, and because the giant is sleepy, he lets her keep them. "I was thinking of killing you but you can have the boots". and then possibly shouting aggresively: "They're yours now Tom!", and he would leave to sleep.

The Knight could craft a rapier out of a giant needle, for red who's learning The Tailors light-sword, dance fighting style.

Tom could restock with giant's cotton.

They can't find the balloon again, it's moored in the expansive forest somehow. Would need a small simple repair but it does have a rope ladder going straight to it. Someone else escape from the forest in another story perhaps.

## Summary
- Mr Giant is misunderstood and likes gardening, doesn't like urchin children like we would dislike wild rats or foxes
- The Tailor might acquire excessive cutoffs of fabric (he could use for Tom's family, or anything)
- Tom could have new giant's cotton, the best of all climbing rope.
