The Kngiht is asking questions to discover the fighting prowess of the group, he is concerned how they will hold up against a bandit attack.

The Tailor would respond to The Knights questions answering honestly, but not proud, that he is a master fencer.

The Knight would get up, quickly find a suitable stick and mock (taunt) The Tailor into a duel in a fencing style.

The Tailor would start left handed, as he is but The Knight would adjust to left handed seeing The Tailor is left handed.

The Tailor would kick and trip, and The Knight would be back-footed. The Knight would counter-cick but more brutal than elegant, in desparation, and hurt The Tailors left hand, causing him to fight right handed. The Knight also then switching to right handed and they to at it with more seriousness.

The Tailor would win and The Knight would easily conclude The Tailor was a worthy brother in arms when it came to combat
