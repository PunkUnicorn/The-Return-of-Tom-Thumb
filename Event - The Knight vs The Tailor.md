The Kngiht is asking questions to discover the fighting prowess of the group, he is concerned how they will hold up against a bandit attack.

The Tailor would respond to The Knights questions answering honestly, but not proud, that he is a master fencer.

The Knight would get up, quickly find a suitable stick and mock (taunt) The Tailor into a duel in a fencing style.

The Tailor would start left handed, as he is but The Knight would adjust to left handed seeing The Tailor is left handed.

The Tailor would kick and trip, and The Knight would be back-footed. The Knight would counter-kick, but more brutal than elegant; in desparation, and hurt The Tailors left hand... causing him to fight right handed. The Knight also then switching to right handed, they have at it against each other more seriousness.

The Tailor would conceed: The Knight requires the advantage, since The Tailor is a better fencer. The Knight agrees but does not relent.

As The Tailor whips The Knights stick-sword away, and holds him at stick-point, he would mime sheath the stick, letting it actually drop on the floor, then help The Knight up. The Tailor would conclude: "When I said I was a fencing master I was trying to be modest". But add: "But... We were fighting in my style. if I were to fight you in *your* style... I'm not sure I would be the stick-victor.": he winked. The Knight being objective, modestly agrees.

The Tailor winning allows The Knight to easily conclude The Tailor was a worthy brother in arms when it came to combat.
