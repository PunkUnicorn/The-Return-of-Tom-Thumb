There is the fabled stone of power. 

Some believe they know it’s location, however those who go looking for it never seem to find it. The tales tell of surprise at finding it but for a number of different possible agendas or motivations. The only constant is: if you are looking for it, you won’t find it.

It looks like a small pile of rocks but none of the stones are loose, as if they are all joined. Possibly fused. The pile is either rooted or incredibly heavy because it can’t be moved, lifted nor any of the appearing single rocks, or the whole itself.

It has majestic powers of healing upto and excluding raising the dead.

### Be warned! Its effect is formulaic
If you were cursed after birth this stone would remove the curse
If you lost a limb last year this stone would restore it
If you were born blind and healed subsequently it may revert you to being blind
If you were born cursed and had the curse removed in life, this stone may restore the curse
You get the picture

Perhaps one doesn’t need to touch the stone for it to be effective, be within 5 feet and possibly not even looking at it.

The stone of power could heal Red’s sprained ankle, and Red would dance for the stone as thanks, which the stone would appreciate and express in a non-human, crystalline way: possibly a tone hum out of key with whatever melody The Tailor plays but to the stone of power this deep grating timbre urk of a drone is beautiful. Red doesn’t let it put her off, nor The Tailor
