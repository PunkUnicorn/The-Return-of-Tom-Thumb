# Chapter Four

![](TheKnight/TheKnightPensive_small.png)
Meanwhile, far south, in the most south city, in the southern part of the kings castle, itself in the cities south, an heir to the throne, the crown prince himself, was looking out northwards.

He had the life of a prince. However, if he knew where Tom was, or even who Tom was, he would have been jealous of her life tonight.

No more was he a prince in his mind. To him, being an heir to the throne was like being a caged creature: trapped because of his specific bloodline. But soon he would be free.

For a long time he had been preparing himself a new identity: the appearance and paraphernalia to pass as one of the kings many knights. The most difficult item to acquire: a genuine 'knights ring'. It was also the most necessary piece.

He looked out northwards: the dusk lit city below the castle battlements. It was time, so he went inside. The stone walls of the south tower were deeply cold.

His pack was ready: his formal knight's robe, his standard knight's armour; laid out in neat pieces. He had his 'letter from The Prince' he had written, as part of his cover story. It was safe in his pouch. His disguise complete.

Knights armour had slightly different strapping compared to the princely armour he was familiar with. But he had prepared and practised, and was soon encased in his new metal shell. Dressed in his overrobe, his pack on his back, he was almost ready.

The heavy helmet and visor were the last parts. These amplified his own breath and cropped his vision. The discomfort a reassurance; it would be a good disguise.

The south stair was as deserted as expected, his rattling armour unheard. He followed the spiralling stairs down to the arched tunnels below the keep.

Through the tunnels, each step brought a creeping remembrance of what he was escaping: the responsibility, the throne and the honour of his lineage. There it was, the shame on his shoulders.

But then a flash of what lay ahead: the open road, a life of freedom, to hide away from chains of state. Instead be alive day to day; each morning living a new life. Each morning free again.

So he took more steps, faster steps. But hurrying did not abate the remorse. Regret pushed against guilt to a blur. And a new flash of regret: not preparing a torch for this tunnel escape, it was dark. He had packed a bundle of torches (he had packed everything useful he could think of).

“I could stop and get the torches out...” he thought, mentally navigating through the layers of compacted equipment. He knew the location of everything in his backpack, each item crammed to it's smallest possible bundle.

He would have to take his helmet off to do that. He might be out of the tunnel soon.

More steps forward but misplacing his footing, and almost stumbling, caused him to slow down. He felt a draft of air, the tunnel must conclude soon. “Am I doing the right thing?”. He felt anxious. He stopped. The weight of his pack, the weight of his helmet, but mostly the weight of his choice.

His stomach churned.

The breeze stronger, the cold biting his eyes. And the sound of rushing. It was the sound of rain. Listening, somehow, the prospect of rain was exhilarating; there was little rain in the life of an heir to the throne. Yet here he was, a few steps away.

The tunnel narrowed and led round to the left. Following this, the smell of rain and the outside. The tunnel became a narrow cave and an opening overlooking fields.

Looking out of the cave, into the misty rain, his anxiety rose; the prospect of the constricting life behind him, the escape to freedom in front. The sound of the rain neither diminishing or increasing; it was a flat boring constant he found himself aching for.

He stepped forward, the rain ringing each hit on his helmet, deafening him. Footing was difficult in the wet mud, which made progress humorously slow. His wet robe becoming heavier. A field's fence a major obstacle.

And so his first steps went, travelling near blind in the dark; reluctant to take his visor off, even after tripping into a ditch, and climbing out the other side. Fields seeming to go on forever, the night never ending.

Until morning broke and the rain stopped. For the first time he dared to look back: the castle far in the distance, but not that far... far enough.

He had calculated that first light would be the time people noticed he was missing. Now with the sun he could find north, latch onto a suitable trail and follow this as far north as possible. Right up to The Expansive Forest perhaps?

In the north, for Tom, The Tailor and Kim the weather was dry. There had been no rain that night. Tom woke later than usual; it was already light. Groggy and disorientated she feared she had overslept her family. With great relief she remembered where she was, the sense of liberation was a surprise. This was the first time Tom recognised the burden of life at home.

Still groggy she pulled her calves taught; stretching her feet to a point, arms arching back. The stretch brought a wave of lucidity.

Dust darted through sunbeams from knot-holes. She had nothing to worry about.

But there was something wrong.

Kim and the cow had gone. She instantly knew what this meant: he was telling her to go.

Her feeling of comfort dislodged. She sat up to reassess. The Tailor was asleep. Kim and the cow were still gone.

Getting up quietly Tom took a few careful steps towards the door, pushing it open; enough to peek outside. There was no trace of her brother.

Pushing the door more, she stepped outside looking in the direction of The North Trail. Kim and the cow were long gone, no trace of either.

Tom stood looking northwards, imagining how far Kim might have gotten. The cow was slow, he would be close. She could catch him up, it would be easy.

But she could not take a step; blocked by an elusive, buried reason. She did not want to become aware of the reason. Wherever he was, Kim was walking away, slowly. Again, she thought she could catch him up.

Kim was telling her something though. He had travelled without her deliberately. The elusive reason gaining painful clarity: home was danger.

The hay inside had lost it's bliss, but it felt like the closest thing she had to a home right now, so she went inside.

The Tailor was sitting up, looking at her. His face and eyes showing sympathy. “Could I live here?” she thought to herself. However, would The Tailor live here? She looked at him. “Would you live here?”, she asked, instantly regretting it; obvious that he would not. “Where are you going?”, she heard herself ask.

He thought about this, but dismissed it with a wave of his hand; “That's a rather deep question for the morning.”. He lounged back, stretching. “How about some breakfast first? We can philosophise later.”

Tom deduced she was welcome to be with The Tailor for the foreseeable future, which was breakfast.

- - -

Breakfast was as delicious, if not more so, than the stew the previous evening: eggs, bacon, dark bread and butter. Tom sneaked what she could into her pocket; a sausage. There was no way to put the potato in her pocket, it was too crumbly. So she finished it all, licking her tin plate clean. “Do you eat like this all the time?”

“I try not to.”, he replied, pushing his empty plate forward. He cocked his chair on two legs, leaning his back against the wall instead of the chair's back.

“You asked me where I was going?”, he shuffled into a more relaxing position. “I'm a travelling tailor, I just travel.”

Then, as if he had remembered something, he added: “And I do tailoring.”, using his finger to accentuate.

“What's tailoring?”

Leaning forward, a mirthful twinkle in his eye: “I thought you'd never ask. Let's go and show you tailoring.”

To which he stood up and walked towards the inn's door, beckoning Tom with his head; “Come on.”, a jaunty walk. He was enjoying this.

Outside, Tom stood in a ridiculous way, her arms out straight and her legs apart. The Tailor worked under each of her arms with pins in his mouth. “And I'll do something with your hair.” he tried to say.

“What are you doing?”; tones of anxiety. He took the pins out of his mouth.

“I'm bringing your jumper in, so it fits better around the shoulders. And waist.”, then he paused, pursing his lips, finally adding: “I say fits better, but what I mean is: fits better than not fitting whatsoever.”

She felt exposed standing like this, but she trusted what The Tailor was doing; it must be important for travelling. He continued to sew around each underarm, and similarly on her trousers.

He drew her away from a small pile of fabric she was now standing in, and sat her down on a milestone, explaining: “Now I'm going to sort your hair out.”

She could see some of what he had done to her jumper. It was less baggy, with thick, long stitches across each underarm. On her trousers, the excess length of trouser leg had been cut off and seamed, instead of roll-ups. But there was no opportunity to look closer. Between looks, her head position was adjusted by a gentle hand. Sometimes, but not always, there would be the sound of snipping.

“There...”, he said, bringing a small mirror to her face. Her hair had well defined steps, but was still shaggy. “Just a tidy.”, he underplayed, and then he paused. For a moment, he looked like he was going to say something, but he let it pass.

Moving her arms around, testing her jumper, she was surprised at the lighter feeling. “That's good.”, she said, instantly regretting the vocal impulse. Kicking her legs, she inspected each landing. Now her trousers covered her boots more, which was convenient.

The Tailor looked at her expectantly, as if she was going to elaborate. But she nodded with the minimum of approval. “The next town's not far”, he said, changing the subject, “we'll make it before lunch.”, and he turned southwards: “It's got the third worst inn in the world, you have to see it to believe it.”, he laughed. "Lets go.”

Her clothes felt different, her hair felt different. They started walking. Suddenly, she realised she had absolutely no idea what to expect ahead.
