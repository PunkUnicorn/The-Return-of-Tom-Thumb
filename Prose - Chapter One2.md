While she was at the apple Tom scooped a handful of apple flesh then walked towards the house. She paused to finish eating, gobbling messy mouthfuls. The door latch caught Toms attention: a mangled, rusted wreck that had once been a latch. But Tom had never seen it any other way. The latch on the giants door was the first functioning one she had seen. 

Eating her hands clean she wondered if her mangled latch could be bent back into shape. Then shadows of anxiety arrived remembering how others would react. 

And now aware of her family behind the door defensive instincts pulled her back: stay unnoticed, be invisible: don’t change the latch. Tom closed her mind, stiffened her muscles and pulled the heavy door open.

The overpowering smell of baked apples. The heavy door slammed shut behind her. In the thick air, for a second, Tom was sick of apples. But it passed; chastising herself for the obvious, the apple being a life saver. Besides, the pips in her pocket could be interesting. 

Tom could see there was no good seat available. Around the table sprawled a rowdy mess of brothers. They occupied all but one seat: the smallest and least sturdy. It was the one at the awkward corner of the table. And it was the seat by the draughty wall. Tom wanted to sit so she sat there. 

Often there were brawls over the precious little there was. Seats, or more specifically seats and seat positions, were a common cause of stand-offs. Tom wasn’t bothered. Once or twice she might have had to fight for the right to be left alone. That was worth fighting for but little else was. 

And yet, bellies full, even mitigated tensions were rising round the table; competing voices. She did not look though, not a time to risk eye contact. She froze for a moment to listen and judge the tone of aggression in the voices. Quickly an intuitive gut chord reassured her the situation was safe.

Wiggling her toes, squashing them against the leather of the boots, the comfort winning the battle for her senses. Beautifully fitting boots drowned out the sound. Comfort was her entertainment for the evening.

Next morning Tom woke earlier than anyone else. With well practised tiptoeing she stepped between sleeping siblings, got to the door and slipped outside. The first thing she saw: brown leaning apple core. 

The bright morning sun spared the eye no mercy and the giant apple core was looking far from adequate. Tom released her expectations were wrong. 

The house door opened quietly behind her, Tom looked round. It was the oldest and biggest of the brothers, Kim. Relaxing Tom looked back at the apple. Kim joined her 

“You’re up early?” Kim asked.

“Yes.” Replied Tom.

Tom wanted to tell Kim of her plan to head to the village and sell the pips. At the same time she was hoping to keep it a secret. 

“What you doin’?” Kim accused. 

Tom braced her upper body and relaxed her legs shifting weight between feet, ready to flinch. “I’m going to the village.” Tom replied.

Nothing happened. Nothing happened for too long. Very quickly several more possible outcomes sprung to Toms mind; she was ready to dodge. But no, nothing. Tom chanced a gauging side glance towards Kim.

Kim walked a few steps then stopped to pick up a choice stick. A sturdy branch used the previous day by her brothers in high spirits. It was almost as tall as Tom. Kim held it as a staff vertically, it’s base on the floor. 

Leaning his weight the staff held. He started walking towards the south trail. “You’re a stupid sod.” he muttered. After a few more steps he inclined his head towards Tom: “Are you coming then?”

The south trail was easy in comfortable boots. Kim had father’s hand-me-downs which were only second generation. They looked more or less like normal old boots. Tom’s pair looked new but obviously too small for anyone other than her and her tiny frame. Early on she had relied on this to stave off others desires on the boots.

She strongly suspected they would fit whoever held them the same way they had fitted for her. Tom had pulled the boots off the giant very easily, accidentally even, and they slid off the giants feet into her hands as a pair of boots exactly the right size for her. 

The long walk (mostly in silence) gave Tom ample time to muse. Dreaming up scenarios starring jealous people at the village, an intuitive cry reminded her: be discrete.

Their progress along the south trail that morning was smooth and pleasant, but they pushed themselves hard with no stopping.

The forest thinned and the trail became a road. It was afternoon by the time they could see the dotted buildings far off in the distance. Two rolling hills to cross, they could be there before dark. They hurried to Toms fastest.

By early afternoon the two had reached the village. Kim carried Tom piggy back for the last stretch and he was exhausted. Tom jumped down fidgeting her legs back to normal. With her feet on the ground and her legs becoming legs again she assessed their destination. They had been to this place recently, when fleeing the giants.

Tom saw the collection of buildings as if for the first time. She could not remember much about it having been preoccupied at the time. She could remember the relief on arriving at the village. But then the nightmare before that, at the giants house: giant trying to kill her.

With a concerted breath, and the reassurance of the pips in her pocket Tom gathered her focus. Which, being Tom, took her straight through tunnels into fantasy daydreams... what the pips could be worth?
