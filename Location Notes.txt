East and West smaller to larger. 
Smaller the more east
Larger the more west (also progressively sleepy)
The size difference is gradule but Tom has seven league boots so can go the distance to see this shift

Far far west the giants are titanic and sleep all the time

Woodcutters house
This wooden hovel might have been a house once but long ago fell into disrepair. The roof is leaky with some old wooden board patches as some kind of repair here and there. The walls look unstable with occational boards nailed in a 'x' cross to cover a hole. The Woodcutter and his wife sleep in a cot next to a wall and the seven children sleep all around where beds aren't. There is an open fire which is maintained and orderly. There is little else inside to be untidy. A rickety table and ten mis-matched chairs, some of which are planks nailed together with the minimum of care and just pass as something to sit on.

Carved wooden bowls and spoons clutter up the table as if abandond and there are ten bowls but only nine spoons. The front door sort of closes but not properly.

The giants house
This manor house is opulent in some rooms and homely in others. The kitchen, lounges and hall to the entrance are homely with a strong feminine touch. They are warm and have welcoming smells especially the kitchen. Other rooms including a grand hall with a stone throne, an armoury and meeting hall are furnished in militaristic styles and typically have a variety of huge fearce weapons on the walls.
