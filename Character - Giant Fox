Giant Fox
He's a minor character whos sole purpose is to be Toms first encounter with the devious world. 
This fox comes from far west where he is normal sized, but has migrated east to find smaller easier things to eat
Giant Fox lies all the time
Is utterly charming untill it has the upper hand THEN IT GETS THREATENING
