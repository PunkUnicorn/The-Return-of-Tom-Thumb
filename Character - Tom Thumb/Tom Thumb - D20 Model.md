*She hides to avoid this but if cornered she will fight for a chance to run when possible*

- Stool leg `1d3 (-1 str.) bludgeoning type damage (×2 on critical)`
- Rock `1d2 (-1 Str.) bludgeoning type damage (×2 on critical)`
- Unarmed strike (small being) `1d2 (-1 str.) bludgeoning type damage (×2 on critical)`

   note improved unarmed strike means this is real damage not subdual damage, sure it's between zero and one point of damage. This means it would take about fourteen attacks for Tom to actually kill someone (with seven Hit Points). Not that she would because its not in her nature. Just reading the model. Her punches always leave a bruise, and like a swan it's possible she could break someones bone (critical hit doing 4 points of damage). Not in Toms nature at all but, yeah you get a bruise
