???? something, she leaves home? Settles down and has to â€¦.?

Fame and adventure travelling seven leagues at a time.

Retires? Gets the boots out and goes on a quest?

Gets angry and kicks something with the boots, breaks the boots

They now only go 3 leagues at a time. She discovers new towns

Meets The Knight, The Tailor and Red Riding Hood

The Knight leaves perhaps on uncomfortable terms, The Tailor has to go but Tom rescues The Knight later who turns out to be a prince on the run from his responsibilities. The Tailor is reaquainted after he's done his quest and we see the tail end of that as he parts with those companions

At one point early on Tom Thumb gets angry and kicks something ripping the boots.. They now only go 3 leagues at a time instead of seven. So Tom travels to new towns previously un-accessible, Because of Toms anger Tom sees new forboding towns and can't get home
And all the time there's a pressing over-quest like, get the potion to the sick father

Perhaps a tempered kick could whittle the boots down to one league at a time boots


POSSIBLE STORY STRUCTURE
- Tell the origin story of Tom, getting the boots. Returning home with her brothers and they take pips from a giant apple core
- Travelling to east and west land finding the further west she went the more giant people were, getting progressively taller. 
- Eastwards people get progressively smaller the further she goes.
- Along the way she meets a giant fox who tricks her by beguiling her with a song from his lute, which she kindly agrees to pass to the fox who can't reach it because he's trapped in a snare. Under his spell she frees him and he says "So long sucker, since you were kind I shall not eat you" and as the foxes music fades so she realises she didn't actually trust him enough to have freed him on her own free will... she only did it under a spell. That is her introduction to song magic.
- To the west where the giants are, the further west and bigger the giant the more the giant needs to sleep. At the far extreems titanic giants do nothing but sleep and their dreams are where magic is forged.
- Tom and brother take the pips west (no perhaps east!), meet the giant fox etc (giant fox from the west hunts the little people in the east lol), perhaps Toms brother gets eaten by the fox after the fox tricks them. Tom survives and meets a guy with a cow called Jack, swaps the giant apple pips for the cow explaining their origin (btw Jack has his own adventure when he plants them...) Tom returns home with the cow (but the brother is lost? could be why Tom is disowned from the family and has to travel to meet the party?)
- This is why Tom Thumb's giant was sleeping in the original story perhaps?
- Then switch context and tell the back story of Red
- Then the backstory of The Knight
- Old lady who lives in a shoe, is a giants boot left over from an ancient war with giants. She made the house out of the discarded giants boot because it sidelined taxation stature making her dwelling ungraspable by the word of law and therefore exepmt from tax. That the boot is potentially a mobile non-fixed item doesn''t help trying to pin it down as a house. She has a sprawling mass of children that are no end of trouble to any neighbouring towns
- Then we jump into where The Tailor is without doing his back story
- Then they all meet and shinanigans ensue
- PROFIT!!!!!!!


Through the travels across seven leagues at at time, then three leagues at a time, and finally one league at a time

Going back she is smarter and more experienced, seeing the towns in a new light

Breaking of innocents

Some towns seem like happy land but are abusing others she later discovers, then going back sees the horror through ignorance e.g. happy town thinks the ones they are oppressing are monsters
