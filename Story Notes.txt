???? something, she leaves home? Settles down and has to â€¦.?

Fame and adventure travelling seven leagues at a time.

Retires? Gets the boots out and goes on a quest?

Gets angry and kicks something with the boots, breaks the boots

They now only go 3 leagues at a time. She discovers new towns

Meets The Knight, The Tailor and Red Riding Hood

The Knight leaves perhaps on uncomfortable terms, The Tailor has to go but Tom rescues The Knight later who turns out to be a prince on the run from his responsibilities. The Tailor is reaquainted after he's done his quest and we see the tail end of that as he parts with those companions

At one point early on Tom Thumb gets angry and kicks something ripping the boots.. They now only go 3 leagues at a time instead of seven. So Tom travels to new towns previously un-accessible, Because of Toms anger Tom sees new forboding towns and can't get home
And all the time there's a pressing over-quest like, get the potion to the sick father

Perhaps a tempered kick could whittle the boots down to one league at a time boots


Through the travels across seven leagues at at time, then three leagues at a time, and finally one league at a time

Going back she is smarter and more experienced, seeing the towns in a new light

Breaking of innocents

Some towns seem like happy land but are abusing others she later discovers, then going back sees the horror through ignorance e.g. happy town thinks the ones they are oppressing are monsters
