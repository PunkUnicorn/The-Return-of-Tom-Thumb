Woodcutters house
This wooden hovel might have been a house once but long ago fell into disrepair. The roof is leaky with some old wooden board patches as some kind of repair here and there. The walls look unstable with occational boards nailed in a 'x' cross to cover a hole. The Woodcutter and his wife sleep in a cot next to a wall and the seven children sleep all around where beds aren't. There is an open fire which is maintained and orderly. There is little else inside to be untidy. A rickety table and ten mis-matched chairs, some of which are planks nailed together with the minimum of care and just pass as something to sit on.

Carved wooden bowls and spoons clutter up the table as if abandond and there are ten bowls but only nine spoons. The front door sort of closes but not properly.
