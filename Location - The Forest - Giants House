The giants house
This manor house is opulent in some rooms and homely in others. The kitchen, lounges and hall to the entrance are homely with a strong feminine touch. They are warm and have welcoming smells especially the kitchen. Other rooms including a grand hall with a stone throne, an armoury and meeting hall are furnished in militaristic styles and typically have a variety of huge fearce weapons on the walls.

This place has giant fruit, with giant seads.

This house phases in and out of the plane of clouds and when it is back in the material plane it is always in a new location somewhere in the Expansive Forest.

In another story some dufus called Jack plants a sead from a giant apple and it grows to a beanstalk that reaches the plane of clouds and they Jack further terrorises the poor giant.
